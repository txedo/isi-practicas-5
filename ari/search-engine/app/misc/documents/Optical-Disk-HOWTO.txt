  3.  Phase Change Optical Technology


  3.1.  Introduction

  Optical Phase Change technology is used to create "In Phase" or "Out
  of Phase" bits on a special media for phase change writing. The drive
  uses a LASER of different power levels or LASER intensities to produce
  this effect.  One power level allows the media to flow into a
  crystalline form while the other creates an "Out of Phase" condition.
  The crystallized areas reflect the read Lasers beam with a different
  coefficient of reflectivity than the non-crystallized areas. Thus,
  data can be read from the disk.


  What makes the phase change optical disk special is that it the disk
  is formated with concentric cylinders or tracks with each track being
  sectored much like a magnetic disk or read/write optical disk. The
  tracks are very close so a lot of data can be stored on a disk. This
  is different from a CD-ROM in that it gives your system the look and
  feel of a magnetic disk. CD-ROMs have a spiraling track much like a
  audio record. Having tracks and sectors alone would not make the phase
  change drive special from optical disk but the drive has some very
  special properties; The phase change drive allows for direct overwrite
  of data which magneto optical can't do inexpensively and the media has
  the very special property of NOT being susceptible to magnetic fields
  or as sensitive to static discharge which gives the media a very long
  shelf life.


  3.2.  Panasonic LF1000


  3.2.1.  POINTS OF INTEREST


  o  Read/Write optical disk.

  o  Can read CD-ROMs at 4X speed.

  o  Can read Kodak PhotoCDs.

  o  Media has a 15 Year shelf life.

  o  SCSI-2 Interface.

  o  Track/sector format as opposed to CD-ROMs spiraling record format.

  o  165ms access time - much better than a tape file restore.

  o  650Mb data storage per diskette.

  o  Diskettes are about $50 each.


  3.2.2.  THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW


  o  Optical disk format not compatible with any other disk drive.

  o  Vendors don't seem to support UNIX very well - marketing is
     targeted for DOS/Windows and Macintosh.

  o  Do NOT purchase the PD drive which uses the parallel port interface
     - To my knowledge there is no Linux driver for it.


  3.2.3.  Installation

  The LF1000 is SCSI-2 compatible device. It features a block size of
  512 bytes and is compatible with the Linux SCSI drivers. This drive
  was installed on a PC compatible AMD 100MHZ 486 with an Adaptec 1542C
  SCSI bus-master controller. To install and mount a disk the following
  steps were taken;


  3.2.4.  Installation steps


  o  Install the drive and set the SCSI address to not interfere with
     other SCSI devices. Reconnect all cabling.

  o  Boot the computer. Your SCSI controller should note the new drive.

  o  During the Linux kernel boot, you should see an additional SCSI
     device. In my case, having a magnetic system disk for device
     /dev/sda it shows up as /dev/sdb.

  o  I did NOT partition the device because fdisk issued an overwrite
     warning and I did not want to change anything from a dosemu
     standpoint.

  o  mkfs -t ext2 /dev/sdb

  o  mkdir /pd

  o  mount -t ext2 -o ro,suid,dev,exec,auto,nouser,async /dev/sdb /pd -
     Read only

  o  mount -t ext2 -o defaults /dev/sdb /pd - Mount drive W/R

  Your ready to "Rock'n'Roll"



  3.2.5.  Usage hints


  o  The media which comes with the drive is reported be re-writable
     about 500,000 times. This means that it is not advisable to install
     a live operating system such as Linux on the phase change optical
     drive. These live operating systems tend to cache processes to and
     from disk. Over time this can easily approach the phase change
     media life.

  o  Mount drive read only as much as possible.

  o  When writing to the drive do so in large chunks. This will help
     reduce any file fragmentation which will require more read seeks.


  o  This is however an excellent media for backups, gifs, mpeg or
     storing large programs which you don't use that often. The restore
     from backup is much faster that tape. Backups can be performed
     using the cp -rp command without the need for the ftape driver.
     This however, will replace symbolic links with the actual file.

  o  If while using the PD for writing, You find that the file you just
     wrote to the disk are not there, chances are that the disk write
     protect tab is in write protect mode and you mounted it in
     read/write mode.


  3.3.  Additional Configuration concerns by Jeff Rooze

  Hello,

  I read your article on configuring the Panasonic LF-1000 for Linux. I
  have configured my system so that the optical drive has its own device
  name and the CD-ROM has its own device name.  This has allowed me to
  mount either media at any time. I do not require any media in the
  drive when I boot Linux. Also I am using the optical drive as an ext2
  formatted media.

  I had a couple of minor difficulties in doing so.


  First, I had configured my hard drive at SCSI ID 6 and my PD at SCSI
  ID 4. (I wanted to have the hard drive at a higher priority that the
  PD). This caused a problem with the Linux SCSI driver. The driver
  scans the SCSI devices from the Lower SCSI id's to the higher (eg: 0
  .. 6).  Consequently my logical device names were assigned differently
  depending on which type of media was installed in the PD drive. This
  caused a big problem. My Linux partition is on my SCSI hard drive and
  the root device name would change! I corrected this problem by
  modifying the software in the kernel SCSI driver to scan the devices
  in reverse order.

  Second, the distribution Linux kernel does not scan all SCSI LUNS.
  The PD/CD drive has a mode that establishes the CD-ROM at LUN 1 and
  the PD at LUN 0. This mode is selected by the configuration switches
  on the PD/CD drive. Switch #2 should be down (off?). If this switch is
  up (on?), the signature of the device is dependent upon the media that
  is installed and it only reports this device on LUN 0. If no media is
  installed I think it defaults to CD-ROM.  I am using an Future Domain
  16-xx SCSI interface card and the software in Linux kernel driver
  supports an optical device signature when scanning the LUNS. I assume
  that this is standard for most of the SCSI drivers. I reconfigured the
  kernel to enable the "scan all LUNS" switch. The kernel then assigns
  different device names for each device. The following is an excerpt
  from by boot log. You will note a series of errors in this log. This
  is because I did not have the optical media installed in the drive and
  the driver was attempting to look at the partition table to determine
  the block size. Fortunately it defaults to 512. I am planning on
  modifying the Future Domain SCSI driver to not do this when it detects
  the optical device.

       >  scsidisk I/O error: dev 0810, sector 0
       >    unable to read partition table of device 0810



  Third, I modified my file system table (/etc/fstab) to list each
  device but do not attempt to auto mount when booting. I have included
  an excerpt from my fstab. The most important options are the noauto,
  rw(ro), and the checkpass flag.

  To create a ext2 file system on the PD, I used the command "mkfs.ext2
  -i 2048 /dev/sdb".



       # fstab - List of file systems
       #
       # device  mount   type          options              dumpfrequency
       checkpass
       /dev/sdb /optd    ext2   rw,user,suid,noauto,sync,exec,dev,umask=0 0 2
       /dev/sr0 /dist  iso9660  ro,user,suid,noauto,sync,exec,dev 0 2



  After making these changes, I have had no problems with mounting
  either media. All I need to do is to load the media and type "mount
  /optd" or "mount /dist" and the system does all the rest.


  I hope this information is useful.

  I tried Jeff's suggestion. Here are the steps I performed;

  o  Modify my kernel using "make xconfig" in the /usr/src/linux
     directory and installed it.

  o  Change the mode jumper on the PD drive to non-DOS mode. I soldered
     a switch across the mode jumper connections and routed it the the
     back panel. I figured out which switch position was the open
     position and labeled this one for DOS.  The other position is of
     course Linux.  So before I boot my system I decide which OS I'll be
     using and set the switch accordingly. History shows it staying in
     the Linux position more and more.

  o  Reboot your system. You should now see multiple LUN show up during
     boot for the PD SCSI device number - It works great!!! If you have
     an older kernel modify the "/usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi/config.in"
     file.

  o  Update the fstab for both CD and PD drives.

  o  Use appropriate mount command.

  o  "df" to make sure your ready.

  I did try moving my primary SCSI drive to 6 but experienced some
  difficulties. Can't remember exactly what it was but it may have been
  that my controller "Adaptec 1542" with "Corel SCSI" requires a
  bootable disk and SCSI 0 for the BIOS install to work properly with
  DOS. So I switched it back and enjoyed playing with my properly
  install PD drive! With this configuration "workman" - the audio CD
  player util - works fine.


  4.  Magneto Optical Technology


  4.1.  Introduction

  Magneto optical drives use a "Far field" magnetic field and a laser to
  change polarization of a magnetic media. The media is of such a nature
  that it must be heated to the appropriate temperature before a
  polarization change can happen - this is where the laser comes into
  play. A high power write laser is used to heat the disk surface to the
  appropriate temperature at which time the "Far field" can set the
  polarization on the disk magnetic surface. After a short period of
  time the disk surface cools and "locks" the polarization into place.
  The read back I'm a little fuzzy on - someone please send me the
  proper wording.  I think a low power laser is used for read back and
  the "H" field of the disk polarization interacts with the "E" and "H"
  field of the incident laser to produce a reflective polarization which
  will correspond to the disk bit polarization - I hope this is in the
  ball-park, it's certainly no home run. Maybe a total strike out.

  The use of a laser for polarization change allows the disk bit and
  track densities to be higher than conventional "Flying" magnetic
  heads. The "far field" means no more "head crashes" - that is assuming
  your disk label doesn't peal off during the load or you don't leave
  one of those sticky pads on the disk cartridge. Most media allows 650
  Megs per platter and on some models both sides of the media is used
  yielding 1.3Gig storage media - you must remove the media and flip it
  over to use the other 650Megs though.

  Stephan Shuichi Haupt <stephan@bios.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp>



  Hi

  I have noticed that there is not much information about
  magneto-optical disks in the howto, which may be due to the fact that
  these are not very popular in general. In Japan, MO drives are very
  common, especially the 3.5' variety with media in 128MB (maybe not
  available anymore), 230MB, and recently 640MB sizes. I suppose there
  is plenty of info on usage of these drives with Linux in Japanese -
  but that does not help most people for some reason ;-) MODs can be
  used very much like any removable media and are handy for smaller
  backups as the media are relatively inexpensive (about 10US$ / 640MB
  as of 10-98). I can only comment on the usage of 230MB drives with
  SCSI interface.

  Drives used: several, no problems encountered (Olympus, Epson, currently
  Mitsubishi MK230LK3). Drives may have strange jumper setting like "Mac
  Mode" or such - naturally, disable.
  If you decide to get a drive, pay attention the the
  cache size - It can speed things up enormously, still speed will be
  soso compared to hard disks, of course.

  SCSI controllers: NCR53C810-based (Asus PCI-200), Adaptec APA-1460A,
  Adaptec AHA2940.

  Just install the drive as you would do with an additional SCSI hard
  disk. It will show up as such. You don't need a disk in the drive when
  booting.

  There are two ways to format the disks:
  a) A bit like a floppy. Just run mkfs on the raw device i.e. something like
  sdb or sdc. I don't recommend this in general (see below).
  b) Like a hard disk. Do fdisk on the raw device and then mkfs on the
  partition as you would for a hard disk (like sdc0, I have never made
  multiple partitions on a MOD).

  What I have not tried is to boot from MOD, yet I cannot see why it
  should not work. I would only recommend it for emergency system
  recovery, however, due to MO drive performance.

  Note: Purchased disks for Doze or Windog may be formatted "like
  floppies" and cannot be used with either O(gre)S right away while MODs
  formatted under linux as hard disks (partition FAT16 / type 6 and
  mkdosfs) will work fine (only tested with NT 3.5/4.0).  Fdisk will
  issue a warning upon exit that concerned FAT16 partitions and you do
  better to take it seriously (look at the fdisk man-page).  The sector
  size will not be automatically set properly for mkdosfs. Use "mkdosfs
  -s 8". That came from some Japanese Web site in mid 1995 (Thanks to Ken
  Kawabata for finding and deciphering it). Using the vfat file-system
  with the disks works fine. I have only used FAT/DOSfs or Linux/ext2
  formatted disks so far.

  Additional Note: The media are probably a bit sensitive. Of course to
  magnetic fields, but also to mechanical stress, some formats seem
  to be more fragile than others (Mac format seemingly worst, data loss has
  occurred when dropping disks during sneaker net traffic).


  Though this does not steer anyone through particularly dense
  jungle, it may be nice for completeness.

  ---------------- December 11 1998 update from Steve -------------------

  OK, some problems will arise with MO disks occasionally. the safest
  way to avoid them is not to use the disks "off the shelf".  trying to
  mount disks can even result in kernel panics. i accidentally tried to
  mount a 640MB disk (format windows95 it said, so maybe FAT32) as -t
  vfat, this is not a thing to try.

  also, 2.0.x kernels don't support 2048b block size (also 640MB disks).
  a patch for 2.0.3x kernels seems to float around somewhere in Japan,
  but i have not yet gotten hold of it.  here a link that certainly has
  an English description:
  http://elektra.e-technik.uni-ulm.de/~mbuck/linux/patches.html
  or search the u-tokyo.ac.jp domain. the page of the developers is
  hidden somewhere.

  the best way to use these 640MB disks is therefore to do fdisk and
  mkfs first. i have only done this with mke2fs on type 83 partitions:
  mke2fs -b 2048 /dev/sdxy

  i will check it out for FAT16 partitions and mkdosfs when i have some
  spare time and disks.

  my kernel version used is 2.1.124 (for all of the above).

  4.3.  Fujitsu DynaMO 640 - Phil Garcia

  pgarcia@execpc.com

    You've probably already received a number of messages regarding the
  Fujitsu DynaMO 640 - I have the 640SZI, which is the internal version;
  the model number given in a SCSI probe is M2513-MCC3064SS.  I recently
  installed this drive practically without a hitch.  I say practically
  because the sector size of the 640 MB disks is 2048 bytes, which is
  not supported in the Linux 2.0.x kernel but is supported in the
  development kernels.  A patch for 2.0.x is available at
  http://wwwcip.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/~orschaer/mo/
  -- also at this site is a patched fdisk to use in conjunction with it.

  Otherwise, installing the drive was no different from installing a
  SCSI hard drive.  It runs well, and I'm very happy with it.

       Dear Skip

       In your Optical HOWTO, you asked for anyone else's experiences of
       installing optical drives under Linux.

       Please find below details of how I managed to get a Panasonic LF-7010
       (SCSI) working on my Sparc Classic.

  5.  Optical jukeboxes

  I have no experience with optical jukeboxes with Linux!!!!  I have had
  experiences with Optical jukeboxes under HP-UX. In this setup the the
  jukebox had a SCSI address of it's own. Each slot in the jukebox had
  an associated LUN number. A device name was assigned for each disk
  slot A side and B side. The mount command was run against the
  appropriate device name. I had a jukebox with just one drive and 16
  optical disk slots - 20 Gig. I thought it was going to be a real
  hassle to write a disk mount manager to share this drive among users
  until I discovered you can mount as many disk as you want and the
  jukebox driver takes care of arbitration - what a nice feature.
  Granted, you only want archive type data here and your overall system
  configuration to be such that not too many processes will be accessing
  the jukebox at the same time. The disk spin down, carriage load,
  carriage move, carriage unload, carriage move to the next disk,
  carriage next disk load, carriage move, optical drive load, and spin
  up takes about 12 seconds - "seek-from-hell".

  Hi,

  I was reading your howto (a life saver, thanks) and I was wondering what
  kind of jukebox you were running?  I have a Maxoptix 520 Jukebox (20
  disks at 2.6G each, nice!) and I would like to connect it to a Linux box
  and serve the drives up to my users, but I'm having problems accessing
  the individual drives.   Currently I can only access the two drives and
  something called MAXLYB which I think is a controller device of some
  sort.

  Basically, I'm wondering if the jukebox you had was the same or similar
  and how you set it up.  I know that you did it under HP-UX, but any help
  right now would be nice.  Hey, I'll even let you log into my linux
  server if you want to take a look at the jukebox and see what it does.
  You can't beat 52Gig of storage!

  Anyway, I'd really appreciate your help.

  What I've come to find out is that Maxoptix is pretty stingy when it
  comes to drivers.  Apparently, they don't make driver software for any of
  their Jukebox carriage controller interfaces!  I don't know how some of
  these companies stay in business.  I'm going to pester them again soon,
  but you are right, this thing will need a carriage controller driver to
  operate.  The cool thing is that this MX520 (that's the model number of
  the juke) emulates a whole slew of other carriage controllers, so maybe
  one of those other guys has a driver.  I'll be looking into that too.

  Hey, if I can't find any driver software, and I can convince Maxoptix to
  give me the specs, I'd be more than glad to write a driver.  I'd could
  sure use the help too since I haven't got enough time to do it on my
  own.  Also, do you know of anyone else doing this that we might be able
  to hack off of?

  Sure, but let me get some new information first.  So far things are
  looking pretty bleak.

  Oh, I don't have this thing at home.  There's no way I could afford the
  $30,000 my boss paid for this thing.  But he's stuck with it and has had
  it sitting around collecting dust for a year, so he's letting me play
  with it and try to find a use for it.

  I'll get back with you when I have some more information.  It should be
  sometime this week when I find out if I can get it to work or not.
