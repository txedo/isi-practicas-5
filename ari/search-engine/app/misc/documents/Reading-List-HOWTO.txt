Revision 1.20            2001-06-14            Revised by: esr               
Removed "Practical Unix Security"; it's five years old and the material is   
now covered better by other books.                                           
Revision 1.19            2001-06-14            Revised by: esr               
Added Ross Anderson's "Security Engineering". Corected ISBNs.                


This document lists the books I think are most valuable to a person trying to
learn Unix (especially Linux) top to bottom.

1. Introduction

1.1. Purpose of this document

This document lists what I consider to be the essential book-length
references for learning Unix (especially Linux) and how to program under it.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2. New versions of this document

New versions of the Linux Reading List HOWTO will be periodically posted to
[news:comp.os.linux.answers] comp.os.linux.answers. They will also be
uploaded to various Linux WWW and FTP sites, including the LDP home page.

You can also view the latest version of this on the World Wide Web via the

sunsite.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Reading-List-HOWTO.html.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.3. Feedback and Corrections

If you have questions or comments about this document (or just want to
suggest a book that you think should be on it), please feel free to mail Eric
S. Raymond, at <esr@thyrsus.com>. I welcome any suggestions or criticisms.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.4. Related Resources

For on-line HOWTOs, magazines, and other non-book material, see the Linux
Documentation Project home page.

Some years ago I wrote a less Linux-focused Unix bibliography that may still
be of some interest and retains a certain amusement value. You can find the
Loginataka [http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/loginataka.html] here.

SAGE, the System Administrator's Guild, maintains an excellent [http://
www.usenix.org/sage/sysadmins/books/booklist.html] list of relevant books.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.5. Conventions Used In This Document

Comments not in quotes below are either mine, or I have seen no reason to
change them from those of Jim Haynes (previous maintainer of this document).
Comments sent in by others are in quotes, and have the name of the
commentator before them (JH is Jim Haynes).

"See" URLs attached to publishing information point directly into the
publisher's web catalog and typically take you to a page containing a cover
shot, blurbs, and ordering information. Books that don't have these lack them
because the publisher is using frames and the catalog pages can't be
bookmarked.

Topic listings go roughly from the outside in (culture to user-land
programming to kernel programming to hardware). Within sections I have tried
to list the most useful books first insofar as I am familiar with them. It's
just an embarrassing coincidence that this lists one of my books first,
honest! (Suggestions for a better organization cheerfully accepted.)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

System Security

Security Engineering: A Guide to Building Dependable Distributed Systems, 
Ross Anderson, 2001, 0-471-38922-6, Wiley.

The best book I've ever seen on technological security measures and general
computer security. The section on "How to Steal a Painting" and physical
alarm systems is worth the price of admission by itself.


Real World Linux Security: Intrusion Prevention, Detection, and Recovery, Bob
Toxen, 2000, ISBN 0-13-028187-5, Prentice-Hall.

This is excellent work, the standard by which future Linux security books
will be judged. I wrote a foreword for it. Combines step-by-step practical
instructions on hardining a Linux system with good theory on attack paths,
rings of protection, and security analysis. Describes many counters for
specific exploits.

Perl rules in its place (though it is now being strongly challenged by
Python). This is the third edition of the definitive Perl book.

Kennedy, 2000, ISBN 0-596-00026-X, O'Reilly & Associates, 680pp..

The best HTML tutorial/reference I have ever seen, and the only HTML book you
need unless you also want to do CGI. I don't know of any other book on HTML
that comes within miles of this one for comprehensiveness, depth, and quality
of organization.

Samarin, 1994, ISBN 0-201-54199-8, Addison-Wesley, 530pp..

`If you are one of those users who would like to know how LaTeX can be
extended to create the nicest documents possible without becoming a (La)TeX
guru, then this book is for you' --- from the Preface. Bruce Thompson adds:
"A very nice book providing a lot of information about the new extensions to
LaTeX, provides a large number of examples showing precisely how your
document's layout can be manipulated"

LaTeX: A Document Preparation System, Leslie Lamport, 1994, ISBN
0-201-52983-1, Addison-Wesley, 256pp..

Bruce Thompson: "The ultimate reference on LaTeX 2.09 by its author. A new
edition covering LaTeX2e (the version included in the current TeX/LaTeX
distribution) is in preparation. LaTeX 2.09 is fully supported by LaTeX2e. A
must for anyone wanting to use LaTeX. Provides a gentle introduction to
document preparation and the various tools that LaTeX provides for producing
professional quality documents. Lots of examples."

0-201-13448-9, Addison-Wesley, 496pp..

Bruce Thompson: "The definitive user's guide and complete reference manual
for TeX. Probably not needed for casual LaTeX use, but a fascinating book
nonetheless." I'll strengthen that by adding that this book is not for the
faint of heart.

METAFONT, the companion program to TeX for designing fonts. An excellent work
if you're planning to design your own fonts for use in TeX and LaTeX.
METAFONT is included with the normal TeX/LaTeX distribution." This book is 
definitely not for the faint of heart.

POSIX Programmer's Guide: Writing Portable Unix Programs, Donald Lewine,
1992, ISBN 0-937175-73-0, O'Reilly & Associates, 607pp..

Linux hews very close to the letter of the POSIX standard (non-conformance is
considered a bug and swiftly fixed). This excellent reference for POSIX is
thus also an excellent reference for the Linux kernel API.

The Linux kernel

The Linux Kernel book, Rémy Card, Èric Dumas, and Frank Mével, 1998, ISBN
0-471-98141-9, John Wiley & Sons.

(Translated from the French language edition of "Programmation Linux 2.0";
same authors; 1997; Éditions Eyrolles; Paris, France.)

A very interesting and informative examination of the operation of the kernel
that fills in the gap between the POSIX interface and "The Design of the Unix
Operating System" and the Linux source code. A good understanding of the
design and operation of a Unix OS is a pre-requisite, but this book is an
excellent help to going beyond that general understanding into actual work.

The primary author is one of the core developers for the ext2 filesystem, and
the Linux Kernel book shows a firm grasp of the matter and clear explanations
and structure. It's surprisingly readable for something working at such a low
level. The book does seem to have suffered a little in the translation to
English -- there are a few typos and grammatical mistakes, but it's quite
readable. (The code example files are charmingly still named in French.)

The book is current to Linux 2.0.35 and foreshadows 2.1 and 2.2. Network
protocol implementations are not covered.

This explains the 386 features for operating system writers. It includes a
chapter on Unix implementation. A lot of the 80386 architecture seems to have
been designed with Multics in mind; the features are not used by DOS or by
Unix.

A.2. History

This was originally a mini-HOWTO maintained by Jim Haynes. I have changed the
emphasis somewhat, trying to make it more a standalone document and less
reliant on the various USENET bibliographic postings. The unattributed
mini-reviews are mine rather than his.
