  1.  Introduction

  PalmOS is the operating system used by the Pilot, PalmPilot, WorkPad,
  Palm III, Palm IIIx, Palm V, and pdQ smartphone devices.  Each of
  these gadgets is a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) and comes with
  programs to help the user keep track of personal information, such as
  addresses & telephone numbers, meetings, todo lists and general notes.
  In this way, they replace the traditional paper address book, calendar
  and notepad.  PalmOS devices improve on earlier PDAs in that they can
  synchronize their data with another computer.  Of course the other
  computer must have compatible software in order to communicate with
  the PalmOS device.  This software is often referred to as a conduit.
  Although 3Com does not support Linux conduits, Linux developers have
  provided a wide variety of applications which share data with PalmOS
  devices.

  2.  General Information

  2.1.  Hardware Installation

  Palm OS devices come with a ``cradle'' for exchanging data with the
  desktop computer.  This device is actually a serial cable with a
  custom holder for the Palm OS devices and an integrated `HotSync'
  button.  Plug your cradle into a spare serial port on your computer.
  When you run each of the stand-alone programs, you will need to place
  your Palm OS device in the cradle and push the `HotSync' button so the
  Palm OS device knows that it has to communicate.  If the Palm OS
  device happens to be off when the button is pushed, it will turn
  itself on.

  For convenience, create a device, /dev/pilot which will be an
  alternate name for the serial port to which your Palm OS device cradle
  is connected.  As the root user, enter the following at the shell
  prompt:


       ln /dev/ttyS0 /dev/pilot



  Replace ttyS0 with the name of the port to which you connected your
  Palm OS device's cradle.



  3.  Sharing Data Between Palm OS and Linux Systems

  3.1.  The pilot-link software

  The pilot-link suite of software tools allows you to download programs
  onto your Palm OS device, and transfer data for the Palm OS device's
  various built-in programs between the Linux system and the Palm OS
  device.  While these programs are not quite as seamless as the desktop
  software that comes with the Palm OS device, they do allow you to copy
  your data in both directions.  In general, each separate program in
  the pilot-link suite manages one type of data.



  3.1.1.  Installing the pilot-link software

  The prepackaged versions will inevitably lag slightly behind the
  master distribution, but will be easier to install and not require
  configuration.  The master distribution might be a better choice in
  those rare occasions when you have been waiting for a particular
  feature or bug fix.

  You can get the Debian Linux (i386) port of pilot-link version 0.8.7
  from ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/dists/stable/main/binary-
  i386/otherosfs/pilot-link_0.8.7-2.deb.  If this file does not exist,
  you will likely find a newer version located in the same directory.
  If all else fails, or if you want a more recent version than has been
  packaged for Debian, you can install the generic distribution, as
  detailed below.  Install this file in the normal manner and skip to
  Using the pilot-link software.

  You can get the RedHat Linux (i386) port of pilot-link version 0.8.9
  from ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/contrib/i386/pilot-
  link-0.8.9-1.i386.rpm.  If this file does not exist, you will likely
  find a newer version located in the same directory.  If all else
  fails, or if you want a more recent version than has been packaged for
  RedHat, you can install the generic distribution, as detailed below.
  Install this file in the normal manner and skip to Using the pilot-
  link software.

  For other versions of Linux or unix, or if you need the absolute
  latest version, download the version 0.9.0 of pilot-link from
  ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/pilot-link.0.9.0.tar.gz.  The
  version number is likely to change, but new versions should end up in
  the same location with a similar name.

  Once you have the software distribution, unpack it with:


       tar -xvzf pilot-link.0.9.0.tar.gz



  If your version of tar does not support the -z option, decompress the
  archive with gunzip, as follows:

  gunzip pilot-link.0.9.0.tar.gz | tar -xvf -



  This will create a directory (pilot-link.0.9.0) containing the source.

  Change your working directory to the source (pilot-link.0.9.0)
  directory.

  Run ./configure.  This will search through your system for information
  needed to compile the software.  configure will set things up to be
  installed in /usr/local by default.  If you want to change it, run
  ./configure --prefix=DIR, where DIR is replaced with the name of the
  directory to which the software will be installed.

  Run make.  This will compile the software.  The software will not be
  installed until later, so that you have a chance to try it out first.
  (If you are replacing an older version with a newer release, you may
  wish to check and make sure that no functionality that you need has
  been broken.  Generally, this is not a problem.)

  As the root user, run make install.  This will copy the software into
  directories under /usr/local (or wherever you specified with the
  --prefix option).  If you can not log in as root, you can install the
  software to some directory where you have write access.

  Don't forget to add any new directories of executables to your search
  path.


  3.1.2.  Using the pilot-link software

  Most of the programs in the pilot-link suite are conduits, that is
  they transfer data into or out of your Palm OS device.

  Each time you use of one of these programs, press the HotSync button
  on your Palm OS device's cradle.  This will initiate the Palm OS
  device side of the data transfer.  Note that not all of these programs
  prompt you to press the `HotSync' button, so you may have to remember
  to do it yourself.


  For more details, and other options to these programs, view the
  corresponding manual page.  There is an overview manual page under the
  name pilot-link.  For the pilot-xfer program, for example, type man
  pilot-xfer at your unix shell prompt.



  3.1.2.1.  pilot-xfer

  Possibly the most useful program in the pilot-link suite, pilot-xfer
  allows you to install programs on your Palm OS device, make a backup,
  and restore that backup.


  To install a program:


       pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -i program.prc



  To backup your Palm OS device:


       pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -b backup-directory



  This will copy all of the databases on your Palm OS device, (including
  programs?)  to a directory called ``backup-directory'', creating it if
  it does not already exist.

  To restore data to Palm OS device:


       pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -r backup-directory



  Generally, you will only need to do this if your Palm OS device loses
  power or if you have to do a hard reset.

  To list the programs on your Palm OS device:


       pilot-xfer /dev/pilot -l



  3.1.2.2.  install-memo

  Install a Linux file onto the Palm OS device as a memo.

  To install a memo into your (already existing) project category:


       install-memo /dev/pilot -c project project.memo



  The name of the file will be inserted into the memo as its first line
  and will appear in the directory of memos on your Palm OS device.



  3.1.2.3.  memos

  This program grabs each memo from the Palm OS device and prints it out
  in standard mailbox format.

  To view your memos:


       memos /dev/pilot



  3.1.2.4.  pilot-addresses

  pilot-addresses Transfer the address database to or from the Palm OS
  device.

  To write your address data to a Linux file from your Palm OS device:


       pilot-addresses /dev/pilot -w storage.file



  To read your address data from a Linux file onto your Palm OS device:


       pilot-addresses /dev/pilot -r storage.file



  3.1.3.  Mailing List

  The pilot-unix mailing list is maintained by Matthew Cravit pilot-
  unix-owner@lists.best.com.  Its mandate is:


       The pilot-unix mailing list is for discussion and idea-sharing for those
       interested in using the US Robotics Pilot PDAs with UNIX systems. This
       includes people who are interested in helping to develop tools to allow the
       Pilot to operate with UNIX, and possibly to develop an SDK for the Pilot
       for Unix.



  For more information, including how to subscribe to the list, send
  mail containing the word ``INFO'' to pilot-unix-
  request@lists.best.com.  The subject line does not matter.


  3.1.4.  Mailing List Archives

  An archive of the pilot-unix mailing list can be found at
  http:///www.acm.rpi.edu/~albert/pilot/.  It is maintained by Chris
  Stevens albert@acm.rpi.edu.


  3.1.5.  FTP Site

  An FTP site containing an archive of Palm OS tools for use on unix
  systems is located at ftp://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/pub/PalmOS/.  It is
  maintained by Jeff Dionne jeff@ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca.



  4.  Linux Applications Which Synchronise with PalmOS Devices.

  4.1.  XNotesPlus

  XNotesPlus provides a means to post small notes on your X-Windows
  desktop.  These notes can be shared as memos with your PalmOS device.


  4.1.1.  Installing XNotesPlus

  The XNotesPlus web page at http://www.graphics-
  muse.org/xnotes/xnotes.html contains full installation and use
  instructions.  I suggest using the prebuilt binaries if you can.

  One caveat is that you need to create an ``Xnotes'' category on your
  PalmOS device, if you intend to export notes.



  5.  Data Conversion

  5.1.  MakeDoc

  One short-coming of the Palm OS device's built-in memo program is that
  it does not deal well with large documents.  To compensate for this,
  Rick Bram <mailto:rbram@concentric.net> wrote Doc, a document reader
  for the Palm OS device.  (See
  http://www.concentric.net/~rbram/doc.shtml).  Documents can be
  converted to the Doc format with MakeDoc, by Pat Beirne
  <mailto:pat.beirne@sympatico.ca>.



  5.1.1.  Installing MakeDoc

  MakeDoc can be downloaded from
  http://www.concentric.net/~rbram/makedoc7.cpp.  Compile it with your
  C++ compiler and install the resulting executable as ``makedoc'' in a
  directory in your search path.  There seems to be a small bug in
  makedoc (version 0.7a) in that it does not output a newline as the
  last character displayed to the user.  This does not seem to affect
  the resulting document file, but it is annoying.



  5.1.2.  Using MakeDoc

  Use MakeDoc as follows:


       makedoc data.txt data.prc "Data to display with Doc"



  This will create a file data.prc, which can be installed on your Palm
  OS device with pilot-xfer.  The text "Data to display with Doc" will
  be displayed in the directory of documents that Doc manages.

  The syntax for MakeDoc is as follows:

  makedoc [-n] [-b] <text-file> <prc-file> <story-name>
  or
  makedoc -d [-b] <prc-file> <text-file>



     <text-file>
        The file that you wish to convert.

     <prc-file>
        The name of the resulting file.  (End the name with ``.prc''.)

     <story-name>
        The name you want displayed in the Doc or Jdoc directory of
        documents.

  There are also options to decode the resulting .prc file and manage
  various compression options.

  G.  A History of Palm OS devices.

  There are two versions of the Pilot.  They are the 1000 and the 5000
  and have 128k and 512k of RAM, respectively. They come with Palm OS
  1.0 in ROM.

  Then came two devices with the name PalmPilot.  They are the PalmPilot
  Personal and the PalmPilot Professional and have 512k and 1 Meg of
  RAM, respectively.  They also have a backlighting feature for the LCD
  panel and version 2.0 of the operating system.  The Professional also
  comes with a TCP/IP stack and a few extra programs built-in.

  IBM has released a rebadged version of the PalmPilot Professional,
  which they call a WorkPad.

  Now we have the Palm III, which has a redesigned case and an infrared
  port, not to mention the 2 Meg of RAM and Palm OS 3.0.
  There is an announced product from Qualcomm, called the pdQ
  smartphone, which is a cell phone that incorporates a Palm OS PDA.
  Don't get all excited about it yet, it will not be released until
  sometime in 1999.

  It is possible to upgrade any Pilot by swapping out the memory card,
  which includes both RAM & ROM.  Of course, this doesn't get you
  backlighting for the original Pilot series.
