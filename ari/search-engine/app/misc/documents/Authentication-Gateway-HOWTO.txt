There are many concerns with the security of wireless networks and public
access areas such as libraries or dormitories. These concerns are not met
with current security implementations. A work around has been proposed by
using an authentication gateway. This gateway addresses the security concerns
by forcing the user to authenticate in order to use the wireless network.

1. Introduction

With wireless networks and public acces areas it is very easy for an
unauthorized user to gain access. Unauthorized users can look for a signal
and grab connection information from the signal. Unauthorized users can plug
their machine into a public terminal and gain access to the network. Security
has been put in place such as WEP, but this security can be subverted with
tools like AirSnort. One approach to solving these problems is to not rely on
the wireless security features , and instead to place an authentication
gateway in front of the wireless network or public access area and force
users to authenticate against it before using the network. This HOWTO
describes how to set up this gateway with Linux.

2. What is needed

This section describes what is needed for the authentication gateway.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1. Netfilter

The authentication gateway uses Netfilter and iptables to manage the
firewall. Please see the [http://netfilter.samba.org/unreliable-guides/
packet-filtering-HOWTO/index.html] Netfilter HOWTO.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2. PAM for Netfilter rules.

This is a pluggable authentication module (PAM) written by Nathan Zorn that
can be found at [http://www.itlab.musc.edu/~nathan/pam_iptables/] http://
www.itlab.musc.edu/~nathan/pam_iptables.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.3. DHCP Server

The authentication gateway will act as the dynamic host configuration
protocol (DHCP) server for the public network. It only serves those
requesting DHCP services on the public network. I used the ISC DHCP Server .
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.4. Authentication mechanism

The gateway can use any means of PAM authentication. The authentication
mechanism the Medical University of South Carolina uses is LDAP. Since LDAP
was used for authentication, the pam modules on the gateway box were set up
to use LDAP. More information can be found at [http://www.padl.com/
pam_ldap.html] http://www.padl.com/pam_ldap.html. PAM allows you to use many
means of authentication. Please see the documentation for the PAM module you
would like to use. For more information on other methods, see [http://
www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/modules.html] pam modules.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.5. DNS Server

The gateway box also serves as a DNS server for the public network. I
installed [http://www.isc.org/products/BIND/] Bind, and set it up as a
caching nameserver. The rpm package caching-namserver was also used. This
package came with Red Hat.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Setting up the Gateway Services

This section describes how to setup each piece of the authentication gateway.
The examples used are for a private public network in the 10.0.1.0 subnet.
eth0 is the interface on the box that is connected to the internal network.
eth1 is the interface connected to the public network. The IP address used
for this interface is 10.0.1.1. These settings can be changed to fit the
network you are using. Red Hat 7.1 was used for the gateway box, so a lot of
the examples are specific to Red Hat.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1. Netfilter Setup

To setup netfilter the kernel must be recompiled to include netfilter
support. Please see the [http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html]
Kernel-HOWTO for more information on configuring and compiling your kernel.

This is what my kernel configuration looked like.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

iptables needs to be installed. To install iptables either use a package from
your distribution or install from source. Once the above options were
compiled in the new kernel and iptables was installed, I set the following
default firewall rules.
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE                    |
|   iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -m state --state NEW, INVALID -j DROP         |
|   iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -m state --state NEW, INVALID -j DROP       |
|   iptables -I FORWARD -o eth0 -j DROP                                     |
|   iptables -I FORWARD -s 10.0.1.0/24 -d 10.0.1.1 -j ACCEPT                |
|                                                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The above commands can also be put in an initscript to start up when the
server restarts. To make sure the rules have been added issue the following
commands:
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   iptables -v -t nat -L                                                   |
|   iptables -v -t filter -L                                                |
|                                                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

To save these rules I used Red Hat's init scripts.
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   /etc/init.d/iptables save                                               |
|   /etc/init.d/iptables restart                                            |
|                                                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Once the rules are in place turn on IP forwarding by executing this command.
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward                                  |
|                                                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

To make sure ip forwarding is enabled when the machine restarts add the
following line to /etc/sysctl.conf.
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1                                                 |
|                                                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Now the gateway box will be able to do network address translation (NAT), but
it will drop all forwarding packets except those coming from within the
public network and bound for the gateway.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2. PAM iptables Module

This module is a PAM session module that inserts the firewall rule needed to
allow forwarding for the authenticated client. To set it up simply get the
[ftp://ftp.itlab.musc.edu/pub/pam_iptables.tar.gz] source and compile it by
running the following commands.
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   gcc -fPIC -c pam_iptables.c                                             |
|   ld -x --shared -o pam_iptables.so pam_iptables.o                        |
|                                                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

You should now have two binaries called pam_iptables.so and pam_iptables.o.
Copy pam_iptables.so to /lib/security/pam_iptables.so.
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   cp pam_iptables.so /lib/security/pam_iptables.so                        |
|                                                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The chosen authentication client for the gateway was ssh so we added the
following line to /etc/pam.d/sshd.
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   session    required     /lib/security/pam_iptables.so                   |
|                                                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Now, when a user logs in with ssh, the firewall rule will be added.

The default interface for pam_iptables is eth0. This default can be changed
by adding the interface parameter.
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   session required /lib/security/pam_iptables.so interface=eth1           |
|                                                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This is only needed if the interface name that connects to the external
network is not eth0.

To test if the pam_iptables module is working perform the following steps:

 1. Log into the box with ssh.
   
 2. Check to see if the rule was added with the command iptables -L.
   
 3. Log out of the box to make sure the rule is removed.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3. DHCP Server Setup

I installed DHCP using the following dhcpd.conf file.
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   subnet 10.0.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {                                 |
|   # --- default gateway                                                   |
|        option routers                  10.0.1.1;                          |
|        option subnet-mask              255.255.255.0;                     |
|        option broadcast-address        10.0.1.255;                        |
|                                                                           |
|        option domain-name-servers       10.0.1.1;                         |

3.4. Authentication Method Setup

As indicated in previous sections, I've set this gateway up to use LDAP for
authenticating. However, you can use any means that PAM allows for
authentication. See Section 2.4 for more information.

In order to get PAM LDAP to authenticate, I installed [http://
www.openldap.org] OpenLDAP and configured it with the following in /etc/
ldap.conf.
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   # Your LDAP server. Must be resolvable without using LDAP.              |
|   host itc.musc.edu                                                       |
|                                                                           |
|   # The distinguished name of the search base.                            |
|   base dc=musc,dc=edu                                                     |
|   ssl no                                                                  |
|                                                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The following files were used to configure PAM to do the LDAP authentication.
These files were generated by Red Hat's configuration utility.

/etc/pam.d/system-auth was created and looked like this.
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |   #%PAM-1.0                                                                                                   |
    |   # This file is auto-generated.                                                                              |
    |   # User changes will be destroyed the next time authconfig is run.                                           |

    |   account     [default=ok user_unknown=ignore service_err=ignore system_err=ignore] /lib/security/pam_ldap.so |
    |                                                                                                               |

    |   password    required      /lib/security/pam_deny.so                                                         |
    |                                                                                                               |
    |   session     required      /lib/security/pam_limits.so                                                       |
    |   session     required      /lib/security/pam_unix.so                                                         |
    |   session     optional      /lib/security/pam_ldap.so                                                         |
    |                                                                                                               |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   
Then the following /etc/pam.d/sshd file was created.
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |   #%PAM-1.0                                                              |
    |   auth       required     /lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth |
    |   auth       required     /lib/security/pam_nologin.so                   |
    |   account    required     /lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth |
    |   password   required     /lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth |
    |   session    required     /lib/security/pam_stack.so service=system-auth |
    |   #this line is added for firewall rule insertion upon login             |
    |   session    required     /lib/security/pam_iptables.so debug            |
    |   session    optional     /lib/security/pam_console.so                   |
    |                                                                          |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

3.5. DNS Setup

I installed the default version of Bind that comes with Red Hat 7.1, and the
caching-nameserver RPM. The DHCP server tells the machines on the public net
to use the gateway box as their nameserver.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Using the authentication gateway

To use the authentication gateway, configure your client machine to use DHCP.
Install a ssh client on the box and ssh into the gateway. Once you are logged
in, you will have access to the internal network. The following is an example
session from a unix based client:
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| bash>ssh zornnh@10.0.1.1                                                  |
| zornnh's Password:                                                        |
|                                                                           |
| gateway>                                                                  |
|                                                                           |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

As long as you stayed logged in, you will have access. Once you log out,
access will be taken away.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Concluding Remarks

  * This method of security does not rely on the security provided by the
    wireless network community. It assumes that the entire wireless network
    is insecure and outside of your network.
   
  * The gateway does not encrypt traffic. It only allows you access to the
    network behind it. If encryption and authentication are desired, a VPN
    should be used.
