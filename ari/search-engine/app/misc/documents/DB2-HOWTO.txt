1. Introduction

1.1. Why a DB2 installation HOWTO?

 Ever since DB2 Version 5.2 was ported to Linux in 1998 and made available as
a beta download, there has been a lot of interest in DB2 on Linux. The beta
represented one of IBM's first dips into the waters of Linux, and it
generated a lot of feedback. In fact, if you read through the newsgroups, you
still see occasional questions from people who are trying out the Version 5.2
beta. (I don't know where they're getting it, but they're out there.) And,
not surprisingly, they run into problems. It was a beta product, after all.

 Anyway, I've been trying out DB2 on Linux since Version 5.2, so I've had a
chance to witness the improvements over the past couple of years. I've also
made a lot of use of the Linux Documentation Project in that time, and wanted
to contribute something to the LDP. So I decided to write about the one thing
that I really know something about on Linux, and hope that it helps someone
else out there.

 DB2 on Linux has come a long way since Version 5.2. The first supported
release of DB2 on Linux was Version 6.1 in 1999, which removed many of the
installation hurdles faced by the Version 5.2 beta testers.

 DB2 Version 7.1 is the second major release that supports Linux, and since
it's a new release I'm expecting that a new wave of people curious about DB2,
as well as people migrating from Version 6.1, are going to try installing
this new release on Linux. To that end, I'm writing this HOWTO to share my
experiences and help smooth your installation. One of the big boosts comes
from the standardization on the IBM Developer Kit for Java, which improves
the stability of the DB2 Control Center and enables application developers to
write stored procedures and UDFs in Java. DB2 Version 7.1 also introduces the
ability to write stored procedures in SQL.

 As time permits, I hope to provide hints and tips for improving the
performance of DB2 on Linux, and for configuring the environment on various
Linux distributions to be able to build DB2 applications in C, C++, and Java.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2. Who should read this HOWTO?

 If you plan to install DB2 Version 7.1 on one of the Linux distributions
supported by IBM, this document is for you. The distributions that IBM
officially supports are:

  *  Caldera OpenLinux 2.4
   
  *  Red Hat Linux 6.2
   
  *  SuSE Linux 6.2 and 6.3
   
  *  TurboLinux 6.0
   

 For Debian and Slackware, I have included very basic installation
instructions or links to other resources in Section 5. If you have any other
installation success stories, please forward me the details and I'll try to
expand the section. As time permits, I plan to try to duplicate and confirm
these installation instructions.

 If you install DB2 Version 6.1 for Linux and DB2 hangs on the db2start
command, see [http://www-1.ibm.com/servlet/support/manager?rt=1&rs=0&q=
1000814] db2start hangs on Linux distributions built with glibc 2.1. I don't
include any other DB2 Version 6.1 information in this document. If you plan
to install DB2 Version 5.2 on Linux, don't! (Have I emphasized that point
enough? All right, I'll stop now.) The Personal Developer's Edition of DB2
Version 7.1 is available as a free (beer) download from IBM, at the DB2
Universal Database download site. Registration is required, and, of course,
your copy of DB2 is only free as long as you don't use it in a production
environment.

 This document is really meant to help you install DB2 Version 7.1 on the
previously listed Linux distributions. I've installed DB2 on all of the
distributions supported by IBM and noted the prerequisites and quirks for
each of them. I don't go into detail about the various features of DB2, or
what each installation option means, but I do cover the basics that you need
to know to get it installed.

1.6. About the author

 Dan Scott has been employed by IBM Canada as an Information Developer since
1998??approximately when DB2 was first ported to Linux. It's probably just
coincidence. He has documented and tested DB2 application development for the
bulk of that time. In his spare time he can occasionally be found mourning
for his dearly departed motorcycle, abusing his body on his mountain bike, or
contemplating how to upgrade his Linux distribution at home (which started
life as Mandrake 5.3 and has mutated wildly ever since) without suffering the
wrath of his girlfriend.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Prerequisites

2.1. What are prerequisites?

 Prerequisites are what you, your machine, and your distribution require
before you will be able to successfully install or use DB2. The required
prerequisites come straight from [http://www.ibm.com/cgi-bin/db2www/data/db2/
udb/winos2unix/support/v7pubs.d2w/main] IBM DB2 Universal Database for UNIX
Quick Beginnings. The suggested prerequisites come from experience. For your
convenience, I've divided them into hardware and software requirements.

Hardware prerequisites

Processor
    x86 compatible (for example, Intel, AMD, or Cyrix). I've successfully
    installed DB2 Version 7.1 on a Pentium Pro 200 and a Pentium II 350. Your
    experiences with other x86 processors would be appreciated.
   
Memory
    For application development, I've found 96 MB of RAM is enough to run a
    small database and test out your applications. Even the Control Center
    responds acceptably if your processor speed is fast enough. In my case, I
    was working with a Thinkpad 600 equipped with a Pentium 233 MMX processor
    and 96 MB of RAM. However, more memory is recommended if you're putting
    your database into production or running multiple services.
   
Free disk space
     Of course, this depends on the components you install, but for a typical
    installation of the DB2 Version 7.1 server, the Administration Client,
    the Application Development Client, the documentation, and the creation
    of a sample database, you will need about 350 MB of free disk space.
   

Software prerequisites

glibc
    2.1.2 or greater. This can be a tough part of Linux to upgrade on its
    own, so if your current distribution doesn't meet this requirement, I
    would strongly suggest upgrading your entire distribution. For example, I
    tried upgrading only the glibc portion of TurboLinux 4.0 from 2.1.1 to
    2.1.3 and ran into a whole world of trouble.
   
     DB2 Version 7.1 should work with glibc 2.1.1. IBM sets prerequisites
    based on the systems with which they tested.
   
kernel
    2.2.12 or greater. I've upgraded to both 2.2.19 and 2.4.3 and recompiled
    the kernel for my own purposes, and DB2 seems to work as well as before.
   
     DB2 Version 7.1 should work with a minimum of kernel 2.2.10. IBM sets
    prerequisites based on the systems with which they tested.
   
libncurses
    4.x. For db2setup to work correctly, this version of the library must be
    available on your system with the following pathname: /usr/lib/
    libncurses.so.4.
   
libstdc++-libc6.1-1.so.2
    A file or symbolic link by this exact name is mandatory. On most
    distributions, this is a symbolic link to libstdc++-2.9.0.so, but on
    several recent distributions this is a symbolic link to
    libstdc++-2.10.0.so.
       
        Note: In previous versions of this HOWTO, I stated that the exact
        version of libstdc++-2.9.0.so was mandatory. I was wrong.
       
   
pdksh
    5.2 or greater. This is a public domain version of the Korn shell that
    both the DB2 installer and the DB2 commands require. You cannot do
    anything with DB2 without installing pdksh.
   
rpm
    3.0 or greater. DB2 for Linux is distributed as a number of RPM packages,
    so you won't get far without this piece of software. For information on
    installing DB2 on distributions without using RPM, see Section 5.
   
Java
     The IBM Developer Kit for Java, 1.1.8 or 1.3, is an optional component,
    but is required to:
   
      +  use the DB2 Control Center to administer your databases using a
        graphical user interface
       
      +  create or run Java applications, including stored procedures and
        user-defined functions
       
   
     As of this writing, the minimum required level of the IBM Developer Kit
    for Java 1.1.8 is the March 22, 2000 release. You can get the IBM
    Developer Kit and Runtime Environment for Linux, Java Technology Edition,
    from the IBM Java Developer Kit downloads web site as follows:
   
      + Version 1.1.8
       
      + Version 1.3
       
   
     Please note: Other versions of Java, such as the Blackdown or Sun JDKs,
    have not been tested with DB2 and are not supported by IBM. And no, none
    of the distributions I have seen so far package the IBM JDK. But do
    yourself a favour, and get the IBM Developer Kit for Java.
   
  Web browser
     DB2 calls the netscape command when you:
   
      +  display the online help for the DB2 Control Center
       
      +  display information using the DB2 Information Center
       
    The easiest approach is to install Netscape Navigator or Communicator on
    your system. Netscape version 4.72 or above is required to display the
    Business Intelligence Quick Tour, because of its extreme use of
    JavaScript.
   
     To use a browser other than Netscape to display online help or
    information, create a link called netscape to your preferred browser
    executable. The link must appear in your PATH. For example, to display
    online help with mozilla, you could create a link in /usr/local/bin with
    the following command:
    bash# ln -s /usr/bin/mozilla-bin /usr/local/bin/netscape                 
   

 In the following table:

  *  unknown indicates that I don't know what the default level is, and I
    haven't installed DB2 on this distribution (your feedback is welcome!)
   
  *  okay indicates that I don't know what the default level is, but it
    worked when I installed DB2
   
  *  ** as a prefix indicates that the default level is not acceptable and
    must be replaced or supplemented with a compatible library

3. Preparing your distribution for DB2

3.1. Caldera OpenLinux 2.4

3.1.1. Before installing DB2 on Caldera OpenLinux

 This section contains instructions that you must follow before installing
DB2.

Preparing for the installation of DB2

 1.  Install the pdksh-5.2.14-1.i386.rpm package from the Caldera OpenLinux
    CD-ROM in the /Packages/RPMS/ directory. For example, log in as root,
    mount the CD-ROM, and enter the following command to install the pdksh
    package:
    bash# rpm -ivh /mnt/cdrom/Packages/RPMS/pdksh-5.2.14-1.i386.rpm          
   
 2.  Remove the jdk package, (JDK 1.2.2 from Sun), since it will conflict
    with the IBM Developer Kit for Java that you will install in the next
    step. To remove Sun's JDK, issue the following command as root:
    bash# rpm -e jdk                                                         
   
 3.  Install the IBM Developer Kit for Java. A brief set of installation
    directions is included in Section 11.
   
 4.  Edit the JAVA_HOME and PATH entries in /etc/config.d/shells/bashrc to
    remove the references to the JDK from Sun and update them to reflect the
    IBM Developer Kit for Java. The section that I changed started as:
        [ -z "$JAVA_HOME" ]&& [ -d /usr/java ] && (                          
                export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java                                   
                [ -r $JAVA_HOME/lib/classes.zip ] &&                         
                  export CLASSPATH=$JAVA_HOME/lib/classes.zip                
    )                                                                        
   
     Replace it with the following section to reflect the default locations
    for the IBM Developer Kit for Java:
        [ -z "$JAVA_HOME" ]&& [ -d /usr/jdk118 ] && (                        
                export JAVA_HOME=/usr/jdk118                                 
                export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin                             
                [ -r $JAVA_HOME/lib/classes.zip ] &&                         
                  export CLASSPATH=$JAVA_HOME/lib/classes.zip                
    )                                                                        
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1.2. Installing DB2 and creating instances on Caldera

 Follow the instructions in Section 4 the generic section on installing DB2,
and go ahead and create the instances. It's probably a good idea at this
point to read through Section 3.1.3 to keep in mind the steps that you need
to take after installing DB2.

3.1.2.1.  What does /etc/login.defs not accessible, using defaults mean?
3.1.2.2.  Okay, DB2 is installed and I created the instances. Now what do I
    do?

3.1.2.1. What does /etc/login.defs not accessible, using defaults mean?

It means something went slightly wrong, but it's okay. You may get this
message splashed across your installation screen one or more times during the
DB2 installation process, but other than not looking pretty, DB2 still
installs correctly. Caldera apparently doesn't include a /etc/login.defs
configuration file. The file controls the default options for the useradd
command for adding new users, including policies like how many days before
the new user's password expires and whether a home directory should be
created for a new user. For more information on the /etc/login.defs file,
refer to the man page for useradd.

3.1.2.2. Okay, DB2 is installed and I created the instances. Now what do I
do?

Now that you've installed DB2, you have to perform some steps to configure
your instances correctly. Keep reading.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1.3. After installing DB2 on Caldera

 This section contains instructions that you must follow after installing
DB2.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1.3.1. Adding instance user IDs to their groups

 The most important step is to manually add the instance user ID to the
corresponding instance group you defined during the instance creation step.
DB2 and Caldera OpenLinux don't get this part of the DB2 instance creation
process right, so you have to do it yourself. You can add an instance user ID
to an instance group in two ways:

  *  Edit /etc/group to add the appropriate instance user ID to the last
    field for each group.
   
  *  Use the COAS utility to manage your groups by selecting KDE menu, 
    Settings, COAS, System, Accounts, then selecting the Groups submenu and
    the Manage Groups menu item.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1.3.2. Changing the default home page in Netscape

 The DB2 Control Center and the DB2 Information Center use the Netscape
browser to display help and documentation. This works for the first document
you display in the browser, but if you try to switch to a different DB2
document (for example, from one book to another), you may instead be
redirected to the default home page set by the Caldera OpenLinux installation
process. I found that this problem went away as soon as I changed the default
home page in the Edit menu, Preferences menu item.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.1.3.3. Removing the Caldera login greeting

 Add a file called .hushlogin to the home directory of each of your instance
user IDs. This should prevent the Welcome to your OpenLinux system! messages
while running DB2 commands.

 DB2 generates these messages on Caldera because the DB2 commands run under
the root user ID, which in turn becomes the instance owner to invoke
commands. Part of this su process calls one or both of /etc/config.d/shells/
csh.login and /etc/config.d/shells/profile, which in turn call the /etc/
config.d/shells/OL-greeting script that contains the offensive string.

 Instead of adding .hushlogin to every user's home directory, you could
probably edit /etc/config.d/shells/OL-greeting to remove the message (or
change it to something else, if you want). I haven't tried it myself, so let
me know what works best.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2. Linux-Mandrake 7.2

 The DB2 server and command line DB2 client works on Linux-Mandrake 7.2, and
I was able to successfully start and use the DB2 Control Center with IBM JDK
1.1.8 (build 20000713).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.1. Before installing DB2 on Linux-Mandrake

Preparing for the installation of DB2

 1.  Install the pdksh-5.2.14-8mdk.i586.rpm package from the Linux-Mandrake
    CD-ROM in the /Mandrake/RPMS/ directory. For example, log in as root,
    mount the CD-ROM, and enter the following command to install the pdksh
    package:
    bash# rpm -ivh /mnt/cdrom/Mandrake/RPMS/pdksh-5.2.14-8mdk.i586.rpm       
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.2. Installing DB2 and creating instances on Linux-Mandrake

 When you run db2setup, you may receive the following error:  ksh: /etc/
profile.d/tmdir.sh[9]: source: not found This is only a warning message and
you can continue installing DB2. If the message interferes with the db2setup
menu, press CTRL-L to clear the screen.

 Otherwise, follow the instructions in Section 4, the generic section on
installing DB2 and creating instances.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.2.3. After installing DB2 on Linux-Mandrake

 With Linux-Mandrake 7.2, there are no special steps to take after installing
DB2 Version 7.1. The DB2 server and command line client work out of the box,
and the DB2 Control Center worked with IBM JDK 1.1.8 (build 20000713).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3. Red Hat Linux 6.2

3.3.1. Before installing DB2 on Red Hat

Preparing for the installation of DB2

 1.  Install the pdksh-5.2.14-2.i386.rpm package from the Red Hat CD-ROM in
    the /RedHat/RPMS/ directory. For example, log in as root, mount the
    CD-ROM, and enter the following command to install the pdksh package:
    bash# rpm -ivh /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/pdksh-5.2.14-2.i386.rpm            
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3.2. Installing DB2 and creating instances on Red Hat

 Follow the instructions in Section 4, the generic section on installing DB2
and creating instances.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.3.3. After installing DB2 on Red Hat

 With Red Hat 6.2, you don't need to take any special steps after installing
DB2 Version 7.1. It works.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.4. Red Hat Linux 7.1

3.4.1. Before installing DB2 on Red Hat

Preparing for the installation of DB2

 1.  Install the pdksh-5.2.14-12.i386.rpm package from Red Hat CD-ROM (2) in
    the /RedHat/RPMS/ directory. For example, log in as root, mount the
    CD-ROM, and enter the following command to install the pdksh package:
    bash# rpm -ivh /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/pdksh-5.2.14-12.i386.rpm           
   
 2.  For a compatible version of the libstdc++ library, install the
    compat-egcs-c++-6.2-1.1.2.14.i386.rpm package from Red Hat CD-ROM (2) in
    the /RedHat/RPMS/ directory. For example, log in as root, mount the
    CD-ROM, and enter the following command to install the compat-egcs-c++
    package:
    bash# rpm -ivh /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/compat-egcs-c++-6.2-1.1.2.14.i386.rpm
   
 3.  Install the compat-libs-6.2-3.i386.rpm package from Red Hat CD-ROM (2)
    in the /RedHat/RPMS/ directory. For example, log in as root, mount the
    CD-ROM, and enter the following command to install the compat-libs
    package:
    bash# rpm -ivh /mnt/cdrom/RedHat/RPMS/compat-libs-6.2-3.i386.rpm         
   
 4.  The db2setup command looks for a file called /usr/lib/libncurses.so.4
    and will not proceed unless it exists, so create a symbolic link from the
    ncurses4.0 library in /usr/i386-glibc21-linux/lib/ to your /usr/lib/
    directory.
    bash# ln -sf /usr/i386-glibc21-linux/lib/libncurses.so.4.0 /usr/lib/libncurses.so.4  
   
 5.  The default setting for the msgmni kernel parameter only allows a couple
    of simultaneous connections to DB2. To set this value at at boot time,
    append the following lines to /etc/sysctl.conf:
    # Sets maximum number of message queues to 128                           
    # Set this to 1024 or higher on production systems                       
    kernel.msgmni = 128                                                      
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4.2. Installing DB2 and creating instances on Red Hat

 Follow the instructions in Section 4, the generic section on installing DB2
and creating instances.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.4.3. After installing DB2 on Red Hat

 Red Hat 7.1 enabled the floating point stack feature of the glibc library.
Unfortunately, this causes Java programs using IBM JDK 1.1.8, including the
DB2 Control Center, to fail miserably. Fortunately, you can disable the
floating point stack by setting the LD_ASSUME_KERNEL environment variable to
2.2.5 before running the DB2 Control Center as follows:
bash$ export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5                                          
bash$ db2jstrt 6790                                                          
bash$ db2cc 6790                                                             

 With IBM JDK 1.3 (IBMJava2-SDK-1.3-7.0-i386.rpm), the DB2 Control Center
started successfully without any workarounds. For instructions on installing
the IBM JDK, see Section 11.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.5. SuSE Linux

3.5.1. Before installing DB2 on SuSE

 At some point in its past, SuSE included an old beta version of DB2 in their
distribution. When you install SuSE Linux, up to and including version 7.0,
the SuSE installer still creates the default DB2 user IDs and sets their home
directories in /usr/lib. This can cause some difficulties when you set up the
DB2 instances. Before installing DB2, remove the default DB2 user IDs by
issuing the following commands as root:
bash# userdel -r db2as                                                       
bash# userdel -r db2fenc1                                                    
bash# userdel -r db2inst1                                                    
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.5.2. Installing DB2 and creating instances on SuSE

 Follow the instructions in Section 4, the generic section on installing DB2.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.5.3. After installing DB2 on SuSE

 With SuSE 6.2 or above, I have not needed to take any special steps after
installing DB2 Version 7.1. It just works??and that's nice.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.6. TurboLinux 6.0

3.6.1. Before installing DB2 on TurboLinux

 TurboLinux 6.0 includes all of the required packages at or above the minimum
required levels for DB2 Version 7.1.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.6.2. Installing DB2 on TurboLinux

 Follow the instructions in Section 4, the generic section on installing DB2.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.6.3. After installing DB2 on TurboLinux

 When you run the DB2 Control Center with TurboLinux 6.0, the console window
may display a number of map failed messages. These messages do not indicate a
serious problem, so do not worry about them.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Installing DB2 using db2setup

 The purpose of this section is to walk you through a typical install of DB2
Version 7.1 on Linux. The following section, Section 6, tells you how to
create both a DB2 Administration Server and a DB2 instance. For in-depth
information on the components offered by DB2 Version 7.1, consult the
following documents:

  *  [http://www.ibm.com/cgi-bin/db2www/data/db2/udb/winos2unix/support/
    v7pubs.d2w/main] DB2 for UNIX Quick Beginnings
   
  *  [http://www.ibm.com/cgi-bin/db2www/data/db2/udb/winos2unix/support/
    v7pubs.d2w/main] DB2 Personal Edition for Linux Quick Beginnings
   
  *  [http://www.ibm.com/cgi-bin/db2www/data/db2/udb/winos2unix/support/
    v7pubs.d2w/main] DB2 Connect Personal Edition for Linux Quick Beginnings
   

 For the purposes of this document, I'll assume that you have a copy of DB2
Version 7.1 on CD-ROM. If you download a copy from IBM, just adjust the path
/mnt/cdrom in the following instructions to reflect the directory created by
the tar command.

   
    Tip: Some distributions disable execute privileges on CD-ROM devices by
    default. To mount a CD-ROM with execute permissions at mount point /mnt/
    cdrom, issue the following command as root:
    bash# mount -o exec /mnt/cdrom                                           
   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1. Using the db2setup utility

 You'll find the following executables on the root directory of the DB2
Version 7.1 installation CD-ROM:

  *  db2setup: Use the db2setup command to install DB2 Version 7.1, to create
    or modify DB2 instances, and to create a DB2 Administration Server. Once
    you install DB2, db2setup is copied to the /usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/install
    directory to enable you to create or modify instances without the CD-ROM.
   
  *  db2_install: The db2_install command provides an alternate means of
    installing DB2 RPMs. Unlike db2setup, it does not enable you to create a
    DB2 instance or Administration Server, or install a license key. I highly
    recommend db2setup.
   
  *  db2_deinstall: Use the db2_deinstall command to uninstall the DB2
    Version 7.1 packages on your system. For more information, see Section 7.
   

    Note: The db2setup command provides a terminal-based text menu for your
    installation and instance creation options. Unfortunately, db2setup on
    Linux sometimes encounters a few formatting bugs in terminal emulators.
    Running db2setup from the TTY console works well. Within an X session,
    the rxvt or xterm terminals work quite well, but gnome-terminal is rather
    frustrating to use. If the text menu formats incorrectly, press CTRL-L to
    refresh the menu.
   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2. Installing DB2 components

 The following instructions assume that you are using db2setup to install
DB2.

 To select or deselect a component, highlight the component using the cursor
keys and press ENTER.

 To change the options for a component, highlight [ Customize... ] and press 
ENTER.

 To install your selected components, highlight [ OK ] on the Install DB2 V7
menu and press ENTER.

 The common DB2 files are installed in the /usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/ directory. When
you create an instance, a directory called sqllib is created in the
corresponding user's home directory. The sqllib directory contains symbolic
links to the executables and other files in /usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/.

 The following list describes some of the common DB2 components that you can
install, including estimates of the size required for each component.

Description of DB2 components

Administration Client
     The Administration Client enables database administrators to administer
    local or remote DB2 servers from the command line. This component,
    without Java support or the Control Center, requires about 20 MB of disk
    space.
   
Control Center
     The Control Center (db2cc) is an optional part of many DB2 components.
    It gives database administrators a graphical interface for administering
    local or remote DB2 servers. The Control Center includes the DB2
    Information Center (db2ic), which gives you a graphical interface that
    provides a tree view of the DB2 documentation installed on your
    workstation organized by task or by title.
   
     Note that both the Control Center and Information Center are Java
    applications, so their performance depends on your system's processor
    speed and available memory. This component requires about 90 MB of disk
    space.
       
        Tip: You probably want to install the Control Center.
       
   
DB2 UDB Enterprise Edition, DB2 UDB Workgroup Edition, DB2 Personal Edition
     These components determine the state of your DB2 installation as a
    database server. The core capabilities of the components are the same.
    The difference between Enterprise Edition and Workgroup Edition primarily
    has to do with how they are licensed--Enterprise Edition is licensed on a
    per-processor basis with unlimited users, while Workgroup Edition is
    licensed on a per-user basis. Enterprise Edition also gives you the
    capability to enable DB2 clients to connect to mainframe databases, like
    DB2 for OS/390 or DB2 for OS/400. In contrast, Personal Edition is a
    single user database server that is useful only for developing DB2
    applications. You cannot use Personal Edition as a server because
    Personal Edition does not accept incoming remote connections.
   
     Adding one of these components requires about 40 MB of disk space.
   
    Options for DB2 servers
   
    Replication
         This option enables your DB2 server to replicate data to other DB2
        servers, and, with additional software, across non-DB2 servers as
        well. This option requires about 5 MB of disk space.
       
    Distributed Join for DB2 Data Sources
         This option enables your DB2 server to participate in a join with
        data from other database servers. This option requires about 2 MB of
        disk space.
       
   
   
Application Development Client
     The Application Development Client component installs the headers and
    libraries that you need to create applications using embedded SQL for C
    and C++, Call Level Interface (CLI), Java Database Connectivity (JDBC),
    or embedded SQL for Java (SQLJ). You also have the option of installing
    the source code for sample applications that demonstrate much of the
    functionality of DB2.
       
        Tip: If you plan on developing applications for DB2, install the
        sample applications. The sample directories in /usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/
        samples/ contain build scripts (bld***) that include the compile and
        link options suitable for your own applications.
       
       
        Tip: If you are trying to develop applications and you get an error
        like "That command is not supported in this environment" while trying
        to precompile a file, it's because you either did not install the
        Application Development Client, or you installed it after you created
        an instance and you have not used the db2iupdt command to update the
        instance. See Section 9.1 for more information on db2iupdt.
       
   
     Including the sample applications, this component requires about 10 MB
    of disk space.
   
DB2 Product Library (HTML documentation)
     Documentation is installed into the /usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/doc/ directory. For
    each language that you install, the DB2 installer creates a subdirectory
    with a five-character name corresponding to the language locale. Issue
    the db2help command to fire up your Web browser with a page that links to
    the [file:///usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/doc/html/index.htm] documentation installed
    with DB2.
   
     The English HTML (En_US) documentation requires about 90 MB of disk
    space.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Installing DB2 on other Linux distributions

 DB2 Version 7.1 is distributed as a set of RPM packages. If you want to
install DB2 on a distribution that is not officially supported by IBM, and
that distribution satisfies all of the prerequisites specified in Section 2,
all that you theoretically need to do is find a way to install those packages
on your distribution. The alien utility available from [http://kitenet.net/
programs/alien/] Kite converts RPM packages into formats supported by Debian
(dpkg), Stampede (slp), and Slackware (slp).

Debian
     Susan Williams reported success in installing DB2 Version 7.1 on Debian
    using the following script as root:
   
   
    Example 1. Installation script for DB2 Version 7.1 on Debian
    #!/bin/bash                                                              
    cd /                                                                     
    for f in /mnt/cdrom1/db2/*rpm                                            
    do                                                                       
    alien -d -i -c $f                                                        
    done                                                                     
   
     This script installs every DB2 package on the CD-ROM. In a future
    iteration of this document I plan to provide a description of all of the
    DB2 packages to help you develop a more selective approach for your
    installation.
   
     Christoph Shmitz reports that, while he was able to install DB2 Version
    7.1 Personal Developer's Edition on Debian 2.2 using alien as described
    above, DB2 starts in a time-limited trial mode (90 days). While the use
    of DB2 Version 7.1 Personal Developer's Edition should be unlimited, 
    alien does not automatically install the DB2 license file.
   
     To remove the time limit on DB2 Version 7.1 Personal Developer's
    Edition, you need to manually install the license file (s000510.personal/
    db2/license/db2udbpe.lic in the tar archive) using the following command
    as root:
    bash# db2licm -a db2udbpe.lic                                            
   
     Using alien apparently prevents you from using the db2setup command to
    create instances. To create a DB2 Administration Server from the command
    line, issue the /usr/ibmdb2/v7.1/instance/dasicrt command as root. To
    create a DB2 instance, issue the /usr/ibmdb2/v7.1/instance/db2icrt
    command as root. To get the correct syntax for either command, use the -h
    flag.
   
     For further information on installing DB2 on Linux distributions which
    use the dpkg package manager, see Tiago Antao's page, [http://tiago.org/
    db2-4-linux.html] Agnostic DB2 V7.1 for GNU/Linux.
   
     In the following section, Andika Triwidada describes how to install DB2
    on Debian 2.2 using the rpm command. You can check the prerequisite
    package levels (described in Section 2) installed on your system with the
    following command:
    bash$ dpkg -l|egrep -e '(libc6|libstdc++|pdksh|rpm|zip)'|awk '{print $1,$2,$3}'  
    The resulting list should contain:
      ii  libc6                 2.1.3-13                                     
      ii  libstdc++2.9-glibc2.1 2.91.66-4                                    
      ii  pdksh                 5.2.14-1                                     
      ii  rpm                   3.0.3-1                                      
      ii  unzip                 5.40-1                                       
   
     If you are missing any of these packages, you can install the package
    using apt-get:
    bash# apt-get install package-name                                       
   
    Installation Steps
     1.  Initialize the RPM database.
        bash# rpm --initdb                                                   
       
     2.  Modifiy several files in /bin
        bash# mv /bin/sh /bin/sh.bash                                                         
        bash# ln -s /usr/bin/ksh /bin/sh                                                      
        bash# for f in awk basename ksh passwd sort touch; do ln -s /usr/bin/$f /bin/$f; done 
       
     3.  Copy the contents of the following script to create an RPM wrapper
        called /bin/rpm.
        #!/bin/sh                                                               
        # RPM wrapper, force RPM installation without checking any dependencies 
        if [ "$1" = "-ivh" ]                                                    
        then                                                                    
          shift                                                                 
         /usr/bin/rpm -ivh --nodeps $*                                          
        else                                                                    
         /usr/bin/rpm $*                                                        
        fi                                                                      
       
     4.  Make the RPM wrapper executable:
        bash# chmod +x /bin/rpm                                              
       
     5.  Install DB2 using the db2setup command by following the instructions
        in Section 4.
       
     6. Create the DB2 administration server and at least one DB2 instance as
        described in Section 6. To simplify testing, ensure that you create
        the sample database when you create the DB2 instance.
       
   
    Testing your DB2 installation
     1.  Log on to your Linux server with the DB2 instance user ID. Remember,
        the default user ID is db2inst1.
       
     2.  Prepare your DB2 environment by running the db2profile script:
        bash$ cd ~/sqllib                                                    
        bash$ . ./db2profile                                                 
       
     3.  Run a query against the sample database to test your installation.
        bash$ db2                                                            
        bash$ db2 => connect to sample                                       
        bash$ db2 => select * from employee                                  
        There should be a printout of records from sample database here
        bash$ db2 => quit                                                    
       
   
    After you install DB2
     1.  Remove the RPM wrapper script by removing, renaming, or linking it
        directly to /usr/bin/rpm.
        bash# rm /bin/rpm                                                    
       
     2.  Change /bin/sh back into a symlink to /usr/bin/bash.
        bash# ln -sf /usr/bin/bash /bin/sh                                   
       
   
     After installing DB2 with alien, Claus Reiner reported that:
       
          While all components of DB/2 were installed, the instance
        apparently didn't know them and thus couldn't use them. After a lot
        of sweat going through the configurations, IBM support told me that I
        should make an instance update which solved it. (The instance could
        locally and between Unixen do everything, only when trying to connect
        to AS/400 using DCS it told us 'authentication not supported').
       
    Claus recommends running the following commands as root after installing
    DB2 with either alien or RPM,
    bash# . $INSTANCEHOME/sqllib/db2profile                                  
    bash# /usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/instance/db2iupdt -e                              
   
Slackware
     Thorough information on installing DB2 on Slackware 7.1 using RPM is
    available from James Phillips' page, [http://www.webdaemons.com/

6. Creating DB2 instances

 This section gives you a brief overview of DB2 instances and the DB2
Administration Server, and tells you how to create them.

 Some IBM documentation uses the term "instance" to refer to both DB2
instances and a DB2 Administration Server. The basic similarity between a DB2
Administration Server and a DB2 instance, or "database manager", is that each
is associated with a unique user ID. When you create either a DB2 instance or
a DB2 Administration Server, DB2:

  *  creates one or more new user IDs and corresponding home directories
   
  *  creates a subdirectory in the instance home directory called sqllib
   
  *  alters the .bashrc file to call the ~/sqllib/db2profile shell script to
    set up the environment for the instance
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.1. Overview of DB2 Administration Server

 Like a queen bee in a hive, only one DB2 Administration Server can exist on
any given DB2 server. By locally or remotely logging as the user ID that
corresponds to the DB2 Administration Server, a database administrator uses
the DB2 Administration Server to create, drop, or change the properties of
DB2 instances.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

6.2. Overview of DB2 instance

 To quote the IBM DB2 Universal Database Version 7.1 Administration Guide
definition of an instance:

   
     An instance (sometimes called a database manager) is DB2 code that
    manages data. It controls what can be done to the data, and manages
    system resources assigned to it. Each instance is a complete environment.
    ... An instance has its own databases (which other instances cannot
    access), and all its database partitions share the same system
    directories. It also has separate security from other instances on the
    same machine (system).
   
What this boils down to is that for every DB2 instance, DB2 requires a unique
user ID on your Linux workstation. Security for an instance is provided by
the normal password authentication process for any Linux user ID. Each
instance can contain one or more databases, each of which inherits settings
from their instance.

Creating the Administration Server using db2setup

 The DB2 Administration Server requires about 3 MB of disk space. The
following steps guide you through the process of creating a DB2
Administration Server.

 1.  Issue the db2setup command as described in Section 4.2.
   
 2.  Select [ Create... ].
   
 3.  Select the check box for Create the Administration Server. The
    Administration Server window is displayed.
   
 4.  Enter a unique user name in the User Name field. You can use an existing
    user name that is not already in use by a DB2 instance, but it is
    probably simpler to create a new user for each instance.
   
 5.  Select the Use default UID check box. As far as I can tell, this setting
    is always right.
   
 6.  Enter a unique group name in the Group Name field. You can use an
    existing group name if you wish, but creating a new group ensures that
    you do not inadvertently give permissions to other users on your system.
   
 7.  Select the Use default GID check box. Again, as far as I can tell, this
    setting is always right.
   
 8.  Ensure that the value of the Home Directory field reflects the home
    directory of the user ID.
   
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                Warning                                |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |SuSE users: The prefix for the home directory may default to /usr/lib/ |
    |db2/. This is almost certainly wrong; the value for a standard SuSE    |
    |system should be /home/.                                               |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   
 9.  Enter a unique password in the Password and Verify Password fields.
   
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                Warning                                |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |Enter a new password! If you do not enter a new password in these      |
    |fields, DB2 assigns the default password ibmdb2, giving crackers a     |
    |wide-open front door to your system.                                   |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   

Creating a DB2 instance using db2setup

 A DB2 instance requires about 2 MB of disk space. A sample database for a
DB2 instance requires about 16 MB of disk space. The following steps guide
you through the process of creating a DB2 instance.

 1.  Issue the db2setup command as described in Section 4.2.
   
 2.  Select [ Create... ].
   
 3.  Select the Create a DB2 Instance check box. The DB2 Instance window is
    displayed.
   
 4.  Enter a unique user name in the User Name field. You can use an existing
    user name that is not already in use by a DB2 instance, but it is
    probably simpler to create a new user for each instance.
   
 5.  Select the Use default UID check box. As far as I can tell, this setting
    is always right.
   
 6.  Enter a unique group name in the Group Name field. You can use an
    existing group name if you wish, but creating a new group ensures that
    you do not inadvertently give permissions to other users on your system.
   
 7.  Select the Use default GID check box. Again, as far as I can tell, this
    setting is always right.
   
 8.  Ensure that the value of the Home Directory field reflects the home
    directory of the user ID.
   
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                Warning                                |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |SuSE users: The prefix for the home directory may default to /usr/lib/ |
    |db2/. This is almost certainly wrong; the value for a standard SuSE    |
    |system should be /home/.                                               |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   
 9.  Enter a unique password in the Password and Verify Password fields.
   
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                Warning                                |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |Enter a new password! If you do not enter a new password in these      |
    |fields, DB2 assigns the default password ibmdb2, giving crackers a     |
    |wide-open front door to your system.                                   |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
   
10.  Select [ Properties... ] to change the properties for the instance.
     a.  Under the Authentication Type heading, select the Server Encrypt
        check box. This greatly improves the security of your system, by
        telling DB2 to accept encrypted passwords, rather than plain text
        passwords.
       
     b.  Select the Auto start DB2 Instance at system boot check box if you
        want to start this DB2 instance every time you reboot your system.
       
     c.  Select the Create a sample database for DB2 Instance check box if
        you plan to work with the sample applications available with the
        Application Development Client. To run correctly, most of the sample
        applications require the specific tables and data of the sample
        database. If you do not create the sample database now, you can
        create it later using the db2sampl command.
       
   
11.  Select [ OK ] to create the DB2 instance. The Fenced User text window is
    displayed. Repeat the previous steps for creating a new user and group.
    Server-side DB2 executables, such as stored procedures and user-defined
    functions, execute under the permissions of the fenced user ID. By
    controlling the permissions of the fenced user ID, you control the
    permissions of the server-side DB2 executables.
   
12.  Select [ OK ] to create the fenced user.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Removing DB2

To remove DB2 from your workstation cleanly, perform the following steps:

 1.  Log in as root.
   
 2.  List all DB2 instances:
    bash# /usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/instance/db2ilist                                 
   
 3.  Drop each instance listed in the previous step with the following
    command:
    bash# /usr/ibmdb2/v7.1/instance/db2idrop instance-name                   
   
 4.  Drop the DB2 administration server:
    bash# /usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/instance/dasidrop `/usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/instance/dasilist`
   
 5.  Uninstall all of the DB2 packages on your system using the db2deinstall
    command on your DB2 CD-ROM:
    bash# /mnt/cdrom/db2/db2_deinstall -n                                    
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Using DB2

 This section gives you the basic information you need to start working with
DB2 on Linux. It includes instructions on issuing DB2 commands and SQL
statements from the command line, as well as the commands you need to start
the DB2 Control Center and the DB2 Information Center.

   
    Note: This section assumes that you have followed the instructions in 
    Section 11.
   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.1. DB2 Control Center

 The left side of the DB2 Control Center provides an object-oriented view of
the database objects that you have catalogued, including DB2 instances and
databases on other DB2 servers. One way to add, edit, or drop database
objects is to right-click on an object to bring up a menu.

To start the DB2 Control Center

 1.  Ensure you are logged on to your Linux workstation using either the DB2
    Administration Server user ID or the DB2 instance user ID. If you use the
    su command to become the user, ensure you include the -l parameter to
    initialize the environment for the user.
   
 2.  Start the X server, if it is not already started.
   
 3.  Issue the db2cc command to start the DB2 Control Center. Depending on
    the speed of your system, it may take a few seconds for the splash screen
    to appear, and longer before the full DB2 Control Center appears.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.2. DB2 Information Center

 The DB2 Information Center provides tree views of the information about DB2
that is installed on your system, as well as a number of links to web sites
with further information. If you did not install the DB2 documentation, the
tree views contain fewer links.

To start the DB2 Information Center

 1.  Ensure you are logged on to your Linux workstation using either the DB2
    Administration Server user ID or the DB2 instance user ID. If you use the
    su command to become the user, ensure you include the -l parameter to
    initialize the environment for the user.
   
 2.  Ensure that the X server is started.
   
 3.  Issue the db2ic command to start the DB2 Information Center. Depending
    on the speed of your system, it may take a few seconds for the splash
    screen to appear, and longer before the full DB2 Information Center
    appears.
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
8.3. The DB2 command line

 If you are logged on to your Linux workstation using either the DB2
Administration Server user ID or the DB2 instance user ID, you can issue DB2
commands and SQL statements from the command line.

 If this is your first time using DB2, I would suggest creating the sample
database that ships with DB2. The sample database is used throughout the DB2
documentation and is required by most of the sample applications. To create
the sample database, you can either select the Create the sample database
option when you create a DB2 instance, or issue the db2sampl command from the
DB2 command line.

 Before you can issue an SQL statement, you have to connect to a database. To
connect to a database:

  *  db2 CONNECT TO database USER userID USING password
   

 To connect to a database, and have DB2 prompt you for the password:

  *  db2 CONNECT TO database USER userID
   

 To connect to a database using the default user ID:

  *  db2 CONNECT TO database
   

 Once you have connected to a database, you can then issue SQL statements or
DB2 commands against that database. For example, to select all of the columns
from the EMPLOYEE table in the SAMPLE database, issue the following command:
bash$ db2 "SELECT * FROM employee"                                           

   
    Note: You can avoid typing db2 as the prefix for every SQL statement and
    DB2 command by issuing commands using the Command Line Processor (CLP).
    To start the CLP, issue the db2 command by itself. DB2 provides the
    following prompt:
    You can issue database manager commands and SQL statements from the command 
    prompt. For example:                                                        
        db2 => connect to sample                                                
        db2 => bind sample.bnd                                                  
                                                                                
    For general help, type: ?.                                                  
    For command help, type: ? command, where command can be                     
    the first few keywords of a database manager command. For example:          
     ? CATALOG DATABASE for help on the CATALOG DATABASE command                
     ? CATALOG          for help on all of the CATALOG commands.                
                                                                                
    To exit db2 interactive mode, type QUIT at the command prompt. Outside      
    interactive mode, all commands must be prefixed with 'db2'.                 
    To list the current command option settings, type LIST COMMAND OPTIONS.     
                                                                                
    For more detailed help, refer to the Online Reference Manual.               
                                                                                
    db2 =>                                                                      
                                                                                
    I don't use the CLP because it prevents me from using the command line
    history feature of my shell. I find myself using the command line history
    a lot when I'm issuing SQL statements.
   
     Some users claim that running the CLP within an Emacs shell gives them
    the best of both worlds: they get command line history, and they don't
    have to escape commands that contain lots of quotation marks and
    brackets.

9. Troubleshooting

 The following section covers some of the common problems you may encounter
while installing DB2, creating an instance, or using a DB2 database.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.1. Problems with DB2 installation

 The following section covers some of the common problems you may encounter
when you install DB2.

9.1.1.  When I try to run db2setup, I get the following error: DBI1503E An
    error was encountered when opening or writing to file, "/tmp
    /.dbinst.swp".
9.1.2.  When I try to run db2setup, I get the following error: ./db2inst:
    error while loading shared libraries: libncurses.so.4: cannot open shared
    object file: No such file or directory
9.1.3.  Creating a DB2 instance on SuSE Linux: Default user name already
    exists
9.1.4.  Creating a DB2 instance on SuSE Linux: Default group name already
    exists
9.1.5.  Creating a DB2 instance on SuSE Linux: Default home directory points
    to /usr/lib/db2/
9.1.6.  After creating a DB2 instance, I installed the Application
    Development Client, but I can't use that instance to create DB2
    applications.
9.1.7.  I installed DB2, but none of the permissions in /usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/bin
    are executable!

9.1.1. When I try to run db2setup, I get the following error: DBI1503E An
error was encountered when opening or writing to file, "/tmp/.dbinst.swp".

DB2 issues this error when it can't find the pdksh or ksh shells. This has
probably occurred because you did not install the pdksh package for your
distribution. See Section 3 for more details on installing the pdksh package
for your Linux distribution.

9.1.2. When I try to run db2setup, I get the following error: ./db2inst:
error while loading shared libraries: libncurses.so.4: cannot open shared
object file: No such file or directory

DB2 issues this error when it can't find the libncurses.so.4 library. Red Hat
7 does not include this level of the library in their standard ncurses-5.1-2
package, requiring that you install the ncurses4-5.0-2 library for backwards
compatibility.

9.1.3. Creating a DB2 instance on SuSE Linux: Default user name already
exists

If you did not remove the default DB2 user IDs created by SuSE Linux before
installing DB2 (see Section 3.5), the DB2 Create Instance panel places the
corresponding user ID in the "User ID" field. This can cause a problem when
you change the value of the User Name field to reflect the name of the new
instance, because the value of the "User ID" still reflects the original user
name.

 Ensure that you select the "Use default UID" check box to automatically
associate the new user name with its corresponding user ID.

9.1.4. Creating a DB2 instance on SuSE Linux: Default group name already
exists

If you did not remove the default DB2 user IDs created by SuSE Linux before
installing DB2 (see Section 3.5), the DB2 Create Instance panel places the
corresponding group ID in the Group ID field. This can cause a problem when
you change the value of the Group Name field to reflect the name of the new
instance, because the value of the Group ID still reflects the original group
name.

 Ensure that you select the "Use default GID" check box to automatically
associate the new group name with its corresponding group ID.

9.1.5. Creating a DB2 instance on SuSE Linux: Default home directory points
to /usr/lib/db2/

If you did not remove the default DB2 user IDs created by SuSE Linux before
installing DB2 (see Section 3.5), the default user name already exists and
was created in the /usr/lib/db2/ directory. To change the home directory of
your new DB2 instance, you must manually specify the location of the new
instance. The default home directory is /home/.

9.1.6. After creating a DB2 instance, I installed the Application Development
Client, but I can't use that instance to create DB2 applications.

When you add the Application Development Client after you initially install
DB2 and create a DB2 instance, your existing DB2 instance won't recognize the
db2 prep command. Instead, DB2 returns the following error: DB21051E The
command is not supported for this environment.

 The problem is that when you install a new DB2 component, DB2 does not
automatically update existing DB2 instances to include links to the new
libraries and executables. To update an existing DB2 instance, use the 
db2iupdt command as root:
bash# /usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/instance/db2iupdt instance-name                       
To update all existing DB2 instances, issue the following command as root:
bash# /usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/instance/db2iupdt -e                                  

9.1.7. I installed DB2, but none of the permissions in /usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/bin
are executable!

When you create an instance, as described in Section 6, DB2 copies selected
files from /usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/bin into the $HOME/sqllib/bin directory of the
instance. DB2 sets the appropriate permissions on the copies of the files in
the instance directory.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.2. Problems creating a DB2 instance

 The following section covers some of the common problems you may encounter
when you create a DB2 instance.

9.2.1.  Creating a DB2 instance or a DB2 Administration Server fails.
9.2.2.  db2setup indicated that it successfully created an instance, but I
    checked /tmp/db2install.log and it contains the message DBI1766W Cannot
    change the secondary group list of "" (Caldera OpenLinux 2.4).

9.2.1. Creating a DB2 instance or a DB2 Administration Server fails.

DB2 often fails to create an instance because you became root by issuing the
command bash$ su root rather than bash$ su -l root, which uses the
environment settings for the root account. Check the contents of the DB2
install log in /tmp/db2setup.log. If the installer has issued the following
error message:
  DBI1517E An attempt to execute a command in a subprocess failed.                                    
                                                                                                      
  Explanation: An error was detected when attempting to execute a command in a subprocess. One of the 
  following problems occurred:                                                                        
                                                                                                      
      o The command does not exist.                                                                   
      o Incomplete command search path.                                                               
      o Incorrect access permissions on the command.                                                  
      o System resource problem.                                                                      
then most likely your root account did not have the /usr/sbin directory in
the PATH environment variable for root.

PATH is normally set correctly for you if you log in as root, or issue the
command bash$ su -l root to become root. You can add /usr/sbin to the PATH
environment variable by issuing the following command at the terminal prompt,
or including it in /root/.bashrc:
  export PATH=$PATH:/usr/sbin                                                

9.2.2. db2setup indicated that it successfully created an instance, but I
checked /tmp/db2install.log and it contains the message DBI1766W Cannot
change the secondary group list of "" (Caldera OpenLinux 2.4).

This is one area where DB2 and Caldera OpenLinux don't work well together.
Fix this by manually adding each instance user ID to the group you defined
during instance creation. Here's the full help from the IBM DB2 Message
Reference:
      DBI1766W Cannot change the secondary group list of

9.3. Problems using DB2

 The following section covers some of the common problems you may encounter
when you use a DB2 database.

9.3.1. DB2 is running out of available connections.
9.3.2. I installed DB2 Version 6.1 and db2start just hangs.
9.3.3.  I'm using DB2 PE 7.1 on linux (RH 6.0), and I'm having problems when
    trying to connect with my username and password. I can connect
    successfully to the database with the default user ID:
    bash$ db2 connect to sample                                              
                                                                             
    Database Connection Information                                          
                                                                             
    Database server        = DB2/LINUX 7.1.0                                 
    SQL authorization ID   = userID                                          
    Local database alias   = SAMPLE                                          
    But when I try to connect to the database using the explicit user ID, it
    fails:
    bash$ db2 CONNECT TO sample USER userID                                  
    Enter current password for userID:                                       
    SQL1403N  The username and/or password supplied is incorrect.            
    SQLSTATE=08004                                                           
    Why can't I connect with an explicit user ID?
9.3.4.  When I run any db2 commands, part of the output is Welcome to your
    OpenLinux system!. How do I change this? (Caldera OpenLinux 2.4)
9.3.5.  How do I connect from a DB2 Connect for Linux client to a DB2 for AS/
    400 server?

9.3.1. DB2 is running out of available connections.

You probably need to adjust some kernel parameters. For more information, see
Section 10.

9.3.2. I installed DB2 Version 6.1 and db2start just hangs.

Hey! I said I wasn't going to include any DB2 Version 6.1 information! Oh
well, this is one of the most frequently asked questions about 6.1, so here's
a short answer: you need to install a recent DB2 FixPack. The initial release
of DB2 Version 6.1 ran into incompatibilities with distributions built on
glibc 2.1. For a full description of the problem, and the correct install
procedure, refer to IBM Support document 1000814: [http://www-1.ibm.com/
servlet/support/manager?rt=1&rs=0&q=1000814] db2start hangs on Linux
distributions built with glibc 2.1.

9.3.3. I'm using DB2 PE 7.1 on linux (RH 6.0), and I'm having problems when
trying to connect with my username and password. I can connect successfully
to the database with the default user ID:
bash$ db2 connect to sample                                                  
                                                                             
Database Connection Information                                              
                                                                             
Database server        = DB2/LINUX 7.1.0                                     
SQL authorization ID   = userID                                              
Local database alias   = SAMPLE                                              
But when I try to connect to the database using the explicit user ID, it
fails:
bash$ db2 CONNECT TO sample USER userID                                      
Enter current password for userID:                                           
SQL1403N  The username and/or password supplied is incorrect.                
SQLSTATE=08004                                                               
Why can't I connect with an explicit user ID?

Check the ownership and permissions on the db2ckpw program. They should look
like this:
bash$ ls -al ~/sqllib/security/db2ckpw                                           
-rwsr-s--x    1 root     build       15989 Oct 17 07:22 sqllib/security/db2ckpw* 
If this program is not owned by root, then do the following as root:
bash# chown root db2ckpw                                                     
bash# chmod ug+s db2ckpw                                                     

9.3.4. When I run any db2 commands, part of the output is Welcome to your
OpenLinux system!. How do I change this? (Caldera OpenLinux 2.4)

Caldera OpenLinux includes this annoying message as part of their default
login. For instructions on how to remove or modify this output, see Section
3.1.3.3.

9.3.5. How do I connect from a DB2 Connect for Linux client to a DB2 for AS/
400 server?

Claus Reiner contributed the following procedure:

Preparing DB2 for AS/400 to accept connections

  AS/400 has a special service that must be run and other things that need to
be prepared:

 1.   Name the database and make a *LOCAL entry Command WRKRDBDIRE. There
    should be an entry with a remote location name of *LOCAL. The relational
    database name specified with that entry is the external name of the AS/
    400 database. Typically this is the same name as the system name.
   
 2.   Set the code page to 37. For the user that connects, change the CCSID
    parameter from *SYSVAL to 37, or change it system-wide:
      CHGUSRPRF USRPRF(user) CCSID(37)                                       
    or
     CHGSYSVAL SYSVAL(QCCSID) VALUE(37)                                      
   
 3.   Start a service to listen on port 446. To start the service once:
      STRTCPSVR SERVER(*DDM)                                                 
    To automatically start the service:
      CHGDDMTCPA AUTOSTART(*YES)                                             
   
 4.   Create a NULLID collection by issuing the following SQL statement:
      CREATE COLLECTION NULLID                                               
   
 5.   Possibly create a collection for the user ID to connect with:
      CREATE COLLECTION userid                                               
   

Preparing DB2 Connect for Linux to connect to an AS/400 database

  On the Linux side, you need to perform the following steps:

 1.   Catalog the remote node (the AS/400) with OSTYPE OS400:
    bash$ db2 CATALOG TCPIP NODE as400 REMOTE as400 \                        
              SERVER 446 REMOTE_DATABASE as400_dbname \                      
              OSTYPE os400                                                   
   
 2.   Catalog the remote database in DCS:
    bash$ db2 CATALOG DCS DATABASE as400_dbname AS as400_dbname              
   
 3.   Catalog the remote database:
    bash$ db2 CATALOG DATABASE as400_dbname AS as400_dbname \                
              AT NODE as400 AUTHENTICATION DCS

9.4. Problems starting the DB2 Control Center

 The following section covers some of the common problems you may encounter
trying to start the DB2 Control Center.

9.4.1. When I start the DB2 Control Center with db2cc, nothing happens.
9.4.2. When I start the DB2 Control Center, I get a message box with the
    error SQL1042C An unexpected system error occurred.
9.4.3.  I followed the instructions for installing IBM JDK 1.1.8 but Java
    applications, including the DB2 Control Center, don't work.
9.4.4. The DB2 Control Center starts normally, but the "Systems" folder is
    empty.
9.4.5. When I try to start the DB2 Control Center, I get the following
    message at the console: Xlib: connection to "localhost:0.0" refused by
    server
9.4.6. When I start the DB2 Control Center, I get a message box with the
    error SQL1042C An unexpected system error occurred.
9.4.7. When I try to start the DB2 Control Center with the db2cc command, the
    splash screen comes up, then disappears.

9.4.1. When I start the DB2 Control Center with db2cc, nothing happens.

On some systems, for unknown reasons, issuing the db2cc command will not
start the Control Center. You can often get the DB2 Control Center to start
by explicitly starting a DB2 JDBC server on a specified port, then issuing
the db2cc command with the port number. The following example starts the DB2
JDBC server and DB2 Control Center on port 6799:
bash$ db2jstrt 6799                                                          
bash$ db2cc 6799                                                             

9.4.2. When I start the DB2 Control Center, I get a message box with the
error SQL1042C An unexpected system error occurred.

On most systems, this error occurs only the first time you start the Control
Center. Note that the message box may be mostly covered up by the pretty DB2
splash screen; if this is the case, you have to move the error message window
down and press the "Close" button. The Control Center then starts correctly,
and you should not get the error message again.

9.4.3. I followed the instructions for installing IBM JDK 1.1.8 but Java
applications, including the DB2 Control Center, don't work.

Red Hat 7.1 enabled a floating point stack feature in the glibc library that
breaks the IBM JDK 1.1.8. Other distributions might follow their lead.

 Set the LD_ASSUME_KERNEL environment variable to 2.2.5 before running the
DB2 Control Center or your Java application:
bash$ export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5                                          

9.4.4. The DB2 Control Center starts normally, but the "Systems" folder is
empty.

If the Control Center displays an empty "Systems" folder, you might need to
catalog the DB2 Administration Server manually for the local instance from
which you are trying to run the Control Center. This assumes that you have
created the DB2 Administration Server instance before starting the Control
Center.

 To catalog the DB2 Administration Server, issue the following command:
bash$ db2 catalog admin local node machine-name instance Administration-Server-name system machine-name ostype linux
Now restart the Control Center. Your local system is now displayed under the
"Systems" folder. Do not try this from a client-only install of DB2, because
no local DB2 Administration Server can be available.

9.4.5. When I try to start the DB2 Control Center, I get the following
message at the console: Xlib: connection to "localhost:0.0" refused by server

This normally indicates an X permissions problem that occurs when you log on
as one user, then su to the DB2 instance owner so that you can start the DB2
Control Center. By default, most X servers do not recognize 'localhost' as a
client that is allowed to initiate an X app on your display; it will only
recognize your real hostname. If xauth is set up, then it will complain if a
user ID other than the one that started X tries to invoke an X
application.There are a few things you can try:

  *  Before su'ing to the DB2 instance owner, issue the command bash$ xhost
    +localhost: this tells your X server that 'localhost' is allowed to start
    X apps on your display. Then su to the DB2 instance owner and start the
    Control Center.
   
  *  Log out completely, then log on directly as the DB2 instance owner and
    start the Control Center. You may still have to issue the command bash$
    xhost +localhost before the Control Center will start--recent
    distributions have added this extra level of security.
   
  *  Look into the xauth command and add your primary user ID's ~/.Xauthority
    file to your DB2 instance owner's xauth authority database. I believe
    it's the xauth merge command that you want.
   

9.4.6. When I start the DB2 Control Center, I get a message box with the
error SQL1042C An unexpected system error occurred.

On most systems, this error occurs only the first time you start the Control
Center. Note that the message box may be mostly covered up by the pretty DB2
splash screen; if this is the case, you have to move the error message window
down and press the "Close" button. The Control Center then starts correctly,
and you should not get the error message again.

9.4.7. When I try to start the DB2 Control Center with the db2cc command, the
splash screen comes up, then disappears.

On Caldera, the Control Center didn't work for me until I added the instance
user IDs to the appropriate groups. For more information, see Section 3.1.3.1

Ensure that you have installed the IBM Developer Kit for Java, and that the
directory containing the jre or java executable is in your path. If you issue
the command
bash$ java -fullversion                                                      
, you should get a response like this:  java full version "JDK 1.1.8 IBM
build l118-20000325 (JIT enabled: jitc)" or, for the IBM JDK 1.3:  java full
version "J2RE 1.3.0 IBM build cx130-20000623" Java virtual machines from
other sources may not work. For a quick guide to installing the IBM Developer
Kit for Java, see Section 11.

10. Improving DB2 Version 7.1 performance on Linux

Database administrators running DB2 on Linux often run into problems
attempting to perform the following tasks:

  *  increasing the maximum number of simultaneous connections to the DB2
    server
   
  *  configuring buffer pools
   

The following sections attempt to address those problems.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

10.1. Increasing maximum connections

 One of the most frequently reported problems with running DB2 on Linux is
that DB2 seems to quickly start refusing connections to the server. You can
alleviate this problem by examining an altering several kernel parameters
that control inter-process communication (ipc) limits.

 The number of connections that DB2 can support depends on kernel parameters
that, in the 2.2 kernel, are #define variables included in the kernel source
header files. In the 2.4 kernel, some of these parameters can be set through
the /proc filesystem. Following the description of these variables is a table
listing the default values by distribution. The table includes the values of
these variables in the updated kernel packages for each distribution.

_SHM_ID_BITS
     This variable, defined in /usr/src/linux/include/asm/shmparam.h,
    determines the number of shared memory segment identifiers available to
    Linux. The default value for _SHM_ID_BITS in the kernel source is 7,
    which allows for a total of 2^7, or 128, shared memory segment
    identifiers.
   
     On a single-processor machine, DB2 itself uses a set number (~15) of
    shared memory segment identifiers. On a machine with multiple processors,
    DB2 also requires one shared memory segment identifier per agent to take
    advantage of the Fast Communication Manager (FCM) feature of DB2. Because
    each DB2 connection requires one agent per processor, on a quad-processor
    machine the default value of _SHM_ID_BITS allows less than 32
    simultaneous connections to a DB2 instance.
   
     If you recompile the kernel yourself, you should be able to safely
    increase this value to 9.
   
MSGMNI
     This variable determines the maximum number of message queue
    identifiers. For DB2 Version 7.1 to function correctly, the minimum value
    is 128, but for heavier use consider setting this value to 1024 or
    higher.
   
     In the 2.2 kernel source, this variable is defined in /usr/src/linux/
    include/linux/msg.h. The default value of 128 is acceptable for
    small-scale use of DB2 Version 7.1.
   
     In the 2.4 kernel source, this variable is defined in /proc/sys/kernel/
    msgmni. The default value of 16 must be increased to enable DB2 Version
    7.1 to function correctly. The good news is that you can change this
    value without recompiling the kernel or rebooting your machine. For more
    information, see Section 12.
   
NR_TASKS
     This variable, defined in /usr/src/linux/include/linux/tasks.h,
    determines the number of simultaneous processes that Linux supports. A
    second variable, MAX_TASKS_PER_USER, is defined as NR_TASKS/2. Since DB2
    instances are treated as users by Linux, and each connection uses a
    single process, the maximum number of connections per instance is capped
    at the value of NR_TASKS/2.
   
     The default value for NR_TASKS in the kernel source is 512, allowing a
    maximum of 256 simultaneous connections to a single DB2 instance. DB2
    itself requires a few connections for overhead processes. If you
    recompile the kernel yourself, you should increase this value to
    something like 2048. The stock kernels shipped with the Red Hat, SuSE,
    and TurboLinux distributions increase the value of NR_TASKS to 2560 or
    above. However, Caldera OpenLinux eDesktop 2.4 ships with a kernel in
    which NR_TASKS is set to the default value of 512. Caldera users should
    increase the value of this variable and recompile the kernel.
   
SEMMNI
     This variable, defined in /usr/src/linux/include/linux/sem.h, determines
    the number of semaphore identifiers that Linux supports. This variable is
    particularly important on symmetric multi-processing (SMP) machines. A
    unique semaphor identifier is required for each processor per agent (or
    connection); therefore, on a quad-processor machine, four semaphore
    identifiers are required per connection.
   
     The default value for SEMMNI in the kernel source is 128, which, on a
    quad-processor machine, will only allow 32 simultaneous connections to a
    DB2 instance. If you recompile the kernel yourself, increase this value
    to something like 1024.
   

 The following table shows the default values of the kernel parameters set in
the stock kernel source and in the kernels provided by each distribution.

  *  unknown indicates that I don't know what the default level is, probably
    because it came to my attention after I had already removed the
    distribution (your feedback is welcome!)
   
  *  ?? indicates that I could not find the parameter in the kernel source or
    in the /proc/sys/kernel/ directory. Help, anyone?
   
  *  ** as a prefix indicates that the default value is not acceptable and
    must be increased

10.2. Creating and configuring buffer pools

 A buffer pool is a database object representing system memory used to cache
table and index data as it is read from disk or modified. DB2 allocates a
default buffer pool of 4 megabytes of memory. This is a ridiculous default
for a production database because it will inhibit performance greatly. To get
good performance out of DB2, you must create one or more buffer pools and
associate them with the tablespaces used to hold the tables in your database.
For more information on buffer pools and increasing performance, see the
[http://www.ibm.com/cgi-bin/db2www/data/db2/udb/winos2unix/support/v7pubs.d2w
/main] IBM DB2 Administration Guide: Performance.

 On a system with a 2.2 kernel compiled with support for >1 gigabyte of RAM,
the practical upper limit for buffer pools is about 1 gigabyte of memory due
to the location in memory in which Linux loads shared libraries.

11. Installing the IBM Developer Kit for Java

 This section gives you quick and dirty instructions on how to install the
IBM Developer Kit for Java, version 1.1.8 or 1.3. You need the IBM Developer
Kit for Java to run the DB2 Control Center or Java applications or applets
that connect to DB2. Note that these instructions are not meant to replace
the documentation supplied with the IBM Developer Kit for Java.

+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                  Warning                                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|For DB2 Version 7.1, you cannot use other versions of Java. Versions of the|
|Java Virtual Machine (JVM) supplied by other software organizations are not|
|supported.                                                                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Installing the IBM Developer Kit for Java, Version 1.1.8

 1.  Download the IBM Developer Kit for Java, version 1.1.8, from the IBM
    Java Developer's Kit downloads web site. I'll assume that you download
    the RPM package of the IBM Developer Kit for Java.
   
 2.  Install the IBM Developer Kit for Java by issuing the following command
    as root:
    bash# rpm -ivh IBMJava118-SDK-1.1.8-2.0-i386.rpm                         
   
     I most recently tested IBM JDK 1.1.8 build 20010115a successfully on Red
    Hat 6.2. To see which build of the IBM JDK you are using, issue the java
    -fullversion command.
   
 3.  Add the following lines to your /etc/profile file to set up the Java
    environment for all users:
       export JAVA_HOME=/usr/jdk118                                          
       export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin                                      
       export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$JAVA_HOME/lib/classes.zip                
       
        Note: Caldera users should see Section 3.1.1 for instructions on
        configuring the IBM Developer Kit for Java on Caldera OpenLinux.
       
       
        Note: Red Hat 7.1 enabled a floating point stack feature in the glibc
        library that breaks the IBM JDK 1.1.8. Other distributions might
        follow their lead. If the DB2 Control Center refuses to start
        successfully or your Java applications do not work, you can disable
        the floating point stack by setting the LD_ASSUME_KERNEL environment
        variable to 2.2.5 before running the DB2 Control Center as follows:
        bash$ export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5                                  
       
   

Installing the IBM Developer Kit for Java, Version 1.3

 1.  Download the IBM Developer Kit for Java, version 1.3, from the IBM Java
    Developer's Kit downloads web site. I'll assume that you download the RPM
    package of the IBM Developer Kit for Java.
   
 2.  Install the IBM Developer Kit for Java by issuing the following command
    as root:
    bash# rpm -ivh IBMJava2-SDK-1.3-1.1-i386.rpm                             
   
     I most recently tested build cx130-20010329 successfully with Red Hat
    7.1. To see which build of the IBM JDK you are using, issue the java
    -fullversion command.
   
 3.  Add the following lines to your /etc/profile file to set up the Java
    environment for all users:
       export PATH=$PATH:/opt/IBMJava2-13/bin                                
       
        Note: Caldera users should see Section 3.1.1 for instructions on
        configuring the IBM Developer Kit for Java on Caldera OpenLinux.
       
   
 4.  IBM JDK 1.3 does away with the jre command, even if you install the the
    IBM JRE 1.3 package. However, the db2cc script calls the jre command. The
    easiest solution is to create a link called jre to the java executable in
    the /opt/IBMJava2-13/bin directory by issuing the following command as
    root.
    bash# ln -sf /opt/IBMJava2-13/jre/bin/java /opt/IBMJava2-13/jre/bin/jre  
   
 5.  The db2cc script calls the jre command with the -nojit argument, which
    is not supported in IBM JDK 1.3. Remove the option by changing line 44 of
    /usr/IBMdb2/V7.1/bin/db2cc to the following:
    JRE_OPTIONS="-ss256k -mx128m -Ddb2path=$DB2PATH"                         
   

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Using the 2.4 kernel with DB2 Version 7.1

 The Linux 2.4 kernel changes the default values of some ipc limits. However,
the default value for the msgmni is 16, which causes difficulties running DB2
with the default 2.4 kernel ipc parameters. Fortunately, the 2.4 kernel also
enables you to change a number of these parameters through the /proc
filesystem. With the 2.4 kernel, you do not have to recompile your kernel to
experiment with different parameter values.

 Configure the msgmni parameter by issuing the sysctl command as root:
bash# sysctl -w kernel.msgmni=128                                            
You can also change values directly in /proc/sys/kernel using the echo
command:
bash# echo "128" > /proc/sys/kernel/msgmni                                   

 To set the msgmni kernel parameter at boot time, append the following lines
to /etc/sysctl.conf:
# Sets maximum number of message queues to 128                               
# Set this to 1024 or higher on production systems                           
kernel.msgmni = 128

B. GNU General Public License

     Version 2, June 1991
   
      Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple
    Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA
   
      Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
    license document, but changing it is not allowed.
   
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
B.1. Preamble

 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program
whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation
software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You
can apply it to your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you
wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you
can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that
you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

B.1.1. GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,
DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the
terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any
such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
licensee is addressed as "you".

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the
Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if
its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code
as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it,
thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:

  a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change.

  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License.

  c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
an announcement.)

 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with
the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on
a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for
noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object
code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b
above.)

  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and
installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source
code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in
either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel,
and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
component itself accompanies the executable.

  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to
copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Program.

 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents
or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;
this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free
software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
cannot impose that choice.

  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
body of this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to
ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

  NO WARRANTY

  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

  END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

B.1.2. How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free
software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.         
Copyright (C) yyyy name of author                                             
                                                                              
    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify      
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by      
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or         
    (at your option) any later version.                                       
                                                                              
    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,           
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of            
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the             
    GNU General Public License for more details.                              
                                                                              
    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License         
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software               
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA 
                                                                              

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when
it starts in an interactive mode:
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author                    
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.    
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it                
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.                         

  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be
called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program       
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.     
                                                                             
signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989                                           
Ty Coon, President of Vice                                                   

  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
