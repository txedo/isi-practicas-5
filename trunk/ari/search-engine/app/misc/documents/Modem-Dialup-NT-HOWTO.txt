  This document will help you to setup the Modem to do Dial-up Network­
  ing with remote server like Windows NT RAS or Linux RAS (Remote Access
  Server). You can use the Modem to do Dial-Up Networking on Linux very
  similar to that of MS Windows dialup networking.

  1.  Introduction

  Most of the companies in USA and Europe provide "Remote Access
  Servers"  (RAS), so that their employees can dial-in from remote
  locations either from home or from field.  RAS servers are generally
  Linux RAS servers or MS Windows NT RAS servers.

  Nowadays, Virtual Private Network (VPN) is becoming quite popular
  because it supports broadband and may eventually replace dial-up
  networking which is very slow running at 56KB/sec.  See the VPN HOWTO
  <http://linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/VPN-HOWTO.html> and VPN-Masquerade howto
  <http://linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/VPN-Masquerade-HOWTO.html> and java based
  MindTerm-SSH-HOWTO <http://linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/MindTerm-SSH-
  HOWTO/index.html>.

  Configuring a dial-up connection on Linux is about as simple as it is
  in Windows.  We will use PPP.

  Definition: PPP ('Point to Point Protocol') is a protocol, that makes
  it possible to make IP-Links (Internet Protocol) between two computers
  with a modem.
  The operating system Linux has this protocol in the kernel (If you
  compiled it into the kernel). For a ppp-link you need to start a
  daemon called pppd.

  With PPP you can make a link between two hosts which understand the
  protocol. A link between a Linux host, acting as client and a Windows
  NT server, acting as server, is called a (Microsoft term)

  First, see if your modem is supported by linux.  Internal Modems
  (WinModems) do not work with linux. Some WinModems require special
  tweaking to make it work in linux.

  1.1.  Preparations

  Check if you have all the needed hardware, software and data and hand:


  ·  A modem supported by Linux. Some modems, like most internal PCI
     modems or some external USB modems are so-called WinModems. Which
     means that they rely on Windows-only software to work.  Read
     Winmodems are not modems
     <http://www.idir.net/~gromitkc/winmodem.html> for more information
     and a compability list and check out Linmodems.org
     <http://linmodems.org> for (a few) drivers.



  ·  The modem's init-string. GNU/Linux does not have an equivalent to
     the Windows hardware information file (.inf) mechanism. You may
     have to find out the init-string for your modem yourself. It
     should(TM) be listed in your hardware's documentation or in the
     modem's INF file, but there are also online sources like this list
     of modem init-strings <http://www.spy.net/~dustin/modem/> . If you
     have no clue at all, use ATZ, that works with many modems.



  ·  Provider data. You'll need your login name, password and the
     telephone number. DNS addresses would be fine, too, but are
     optional for recent versions of pppd.


  ·  Check if your modem is connected correctly to the system or
     properly recognized by it.  With an external modem, that's pretty
     easy. As 'root' do echo >/dev/ttyS0 and watch the modem LEDs. You
     should see them flicker for a moment. If not, try echo >/dev/ttyS1
     in case your modem is connected to the second serial port.  With an
     internal modem, use HardDrake to check if the system sees the
     modem. Or use this command to query the PCI list directly: cat
     /proc/pci. If it's an ISA bus modem, check '/etc/isapnp.conf' if it
     is listed there. If you don't have that file, you'll have to
     generate it. Read isapnpfaq.txt in the isapnptools doc directory or
     man isapnp or man isapnp.conf.

  2.  Quick Steps to Dialup Networking

  These quick steps will enable you to setup dial-up networking on Linux
  in just five minutes.

  You need the following packages:

  ·  wvdial*.rpm

  ·  ppp*.rpm

     You can check with rpm -qa | grep -i  wvdial for the installed
     packages on redhat linux. Use equivalent package commands in case
     of other distributions like Debian or Slackware.

  The steps below are for MS Windows NT RAS server. The NT RAS requires
  noauth in wvdial file. The Linux RAS may need different settings.  In
  the sample example given below, you should replace username john with
  the user ID given to you to login into remote RAS server.


  1. Edit the file /etc/wvdial.conf and insert lines like

     ___________________________________________________________________
     [Dialer myconnection]
     Username = john
     Password = passwordofjohn
     Phone = 982 1956
     Area Code = 713
     Inherits = Dialer Defaults
     Stupid mode = 1
     ___________________________________________________________________


  Change john with whatever.



  2. Edit /etc/ppp/pap-secrets and insert lines like

     ___________________________________________________________________
     # Secrets for authentication using PAP
     # client        server  secret                  IP addresses
     john            ppp0    passwordofjohn
     john            *       passwordofjohn
     ___________________________________________________________________


  Change john with whatever.



  3. Edit /etc/ppp/chap-secrets and insert lines like

     ___________________________________________________________________
     # Secrets for authentication using CHAP
     # client        server  secret                  IP addresses
     john            ppp0    passwordofjohn
     john            *       passwordofjohn
     ___________________________________________________________________


  Change john with whatever.



  4. Edit /etc/ppp/options and insert lines like

     ___________________________________________________________________
     lock
     defaultroute
     noipdefault
     idle 1200
     usepeerdns
     proxyarp
     ___________________________________________________________________


  5. Create a new file /etc/ppp/ip-up and insert lines like

     ___________________________________________________________________
     #!/bin/bash

     # This file /etc/ppp/ip-up should not be modified -- make local changes to
     # /etc/ppp/ip-up.local instead

     LOGDEVICE=$6
     REALDEVICE=$1

     export PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin

     [ -f /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-${LOGDEVICE} ] && /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifup-post ifcfg-${LOGDEVICE}

     [ -x /etc/ppp/ip-up.local ] && /etc/ppp/ip-up.local "$@"

     exit 0
     ___________________________________________________________________



  6. Create a new file /etc/ppp/ip-up.local and insert lines like

     ___________________________________________________________________
     #!/bin/sh

     echo "  "
     echo "Before doing route add......"
     echo "Output from netstat -nr is : "
     netstat -nr
     echo "  "

     echo " Doing route add now....  "
     # You should change the lines below and add the networks where
     # your remote machines are ...
     route add -net 156.15.24.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev ppp0
     route add -net 172.28.36.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev ppp0
     route add -net 172.28.39.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev ppp0
     route add -net 172.28.26.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev ppp0

     echo "After doing route add......"
     echo "Output from netstat -nr is : "
     netstat -nr

     echo "  "
     ___________________________________________________________________


  When wvdial is started it automatically starts the pppd which automat­
  ically calls this script to add route to your remote networks via the
  PPP link.  See 'man pppd'.  In the example above I have to connect to
  remote networks 156.15.24, 172.28.36, 172.28.39 via the PPP link. You
  should replace these with your settings.

  You can also manually add or delete the route after starting the PPP.

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ su - root
  bash# route add -net 172.28.26.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev ppp0
  bash# route del -net 172.23.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev ppp0
  ______________________________________________________________________


  7. Create a new file /etc/ppp/ip-down and insert lines like

     ___________________________________________________________________
     #!/bin/bash

     # This file /etc/ppp/ip-down should not be modified -- make local changes to
     # /etc/ppp/ip-down.local instead

     LOGDEVICE=$6
     REALDEVICE=$1

     export PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin

     [ -x /etc/ppp/ip-down.local ] && /etc/ppp/ip-down.local "$@"

     /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifdown-post ifcfg-${LOGDEVICE}

     exit 0
     ___________________________________________________________________



  8. Create a new file /etc/ppp/ip-down.local and insert lines like

     ___________________________________________________________________
     #!/bin/sh

     echo "  "
     echo "Before doing route delete ......"
     echo "Output from netstat -nr is : "
     netstat -nr
     echo "  "

     echo " Doing route delete now....  "
     # Lines below should be same as in ip-up.local but with delete
     route del -net 156.15.24.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev ppp0
     route del -net 172.28.36.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev ppp0
     route del -net 172.23.2.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 dev ppp0

     echo "After doing route delete ......"
     echo "Output from netstat -nr is : "
     netstat -nr

     echo "  "
     ___________________________________________________________________


  When pppd is stopped it automatically calls this script to clean up
  whatever ip-up script did.  See 'man pppd'.



  9. Edit /etc/ppp/peers/wvdial and insert lines like

     ___________________________________________________________________
     noauth user john
     name wvdial
     ___________________________________________________________________


  Change john with whatever.



  10.
     If you have an external modem, then just before dialing, switch
     off/on the power to modem to reset it.

     ___________________________________________________________________
     bash$ su - root
     bash# tail -f /var/log/messages

     Bring up another xterm shell window and
     bash$ su - root
     bash# man pppd
     bash# man wvdial
     bash# cd /etc/ppp
     bash# nohup wvdial myconnection &
     bash# tail -f nohup.out

     Bring up another xterm shell window and
     bash$ su - root
     bash# ifconfig -a
     And you should see ppp device listed and up and running.
     bash# netstat -nr
     And you should see ppp device listed along with other interfaces.
     ___________________________________________________________________



  11.
     By this step the pppd should have established the routes to remote
     networks with ip-up.local script. Also pppd should have created the
     /etc/ppp/resolv.conf for DNS servers. Now, try connect to remote
     host and verify connections.

     ___________________________________________________________________
     bash$ su - root
     bash# tail -100 /var/log/messages | less
     bash# cat /etc/ppp/resolv.conf
     bash# ifconfig -a
     bash# netstat -nr
     I looked for route to network 156.15.24.0 (You should see your
     network as per /etc/ppp/ip-up.local)
     bash# ping 156.15.24.68
     bash# telnet 156.15.24.68

     You can also edit /etc/hosts and add these hosts
     156.15.24.64    starship
     172.28.36.131   gemstone
     bash# ping starship
     bash# ping gemstone
     bash# telnet gemstone
     bash# ftp gemstone
     ___________________________________________________________________



  12.
     To stop the PPP :



     ___________________________________________________________________
     bash$ su - root
     bash# killall wvdial
     bash# killall pppd
     bash# man killall
     ___________________________________________________________________



  13.
     Now enable non-root user to do dial-up networking with PPP.  Make
     sure that the user belongs to the groups `uucp' and `dialout'.

     ___________________________________________________________________
     bash$ su - root
     bash# su - someuser
     bash$ id
     uid=501(someuser) gid=501(maingid) groups=501(maingid),503(staroffice),505(staff)
     This shows the groups 'someuser' belongs.

     bash$ exit
     bash# usermod --help
     bash# usermod -g maingid -G staroffice,staff,uucp,dialout someuser
     bash# chgrp -R uucp /etc/ppp
     bash# chmod -R ug+r /etc/ppp
     bash# chmod -R o-rwx /etc/ppp
     bash# chmod go-rwx /etc/ppp/*secrets
     bash# chmod u+s /usr/sbin/pppd
     bash# su - someuser
     bash$ id
     This will display groups someuser belongs and you should see uucp.
     bash$ nohup wvdial myconnection &
     bash$ tail -f nohup.out
     ___________________________________________________________________


  It is very strongly recommended that you use wvdial as `normal' user,
  and make sure that the user belongs to the groups `uucp' and
  `dialout'.



  14.
     See also the frontend tool for wvdial at X-wvdial <http://console-
     newsletter.hypermart.net/x-wvdial>.



  15.
     If you do not have any other interface ethernet cards for Cable
     modem or DSL modem then you can setup telephone dial-up modem as
     the default route for all outside conections to internet. Assuming
     you only have modem connection via POTS (Plain Old Telephone
     System) you can do -



     ___________________________________________________________________
     bash$ su - root
     bash# man route
     bash# ifconfig -a
     And look for the IP address of the ppp device, and use it below
     bash# route add default gw  IP_of_ppp_device
     For example -
     bash# route add default gw  172.28.36.3
     ___________________________________________________________________



  2.1.  Troubleshooting

  In case you have problems:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ su - root
  bash# tail -f /var/log/messages
  And then start myconnection in /etc/wvdial.conf
  bash# wvdial myconnection

  bash# ifconfig -a
  Should list ppp

  bash# netstat -nr
  Should list ppp

  If you have multiple interfaces, like ethernet cards to DSL or Cable modem,
  to check which route is being used, do:
  bash# traceroute www.yahoo.com
  bash# traceroute remotehostname
  ______________________________________________________________________



  2.2.  Graphical Tools

  Preference should be given the console line commands as in previous
  section, but some people prefer GUI interface.  You can use graphical
  tools like Linuxconf, KPPP, GnomePPP and many others.

  Note: I very strongly recommend using command-line console commands
  'wvdial' as demonstrated in previous sections, as they are lot simpler
  and easy to use.


  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ su - root
  bash# linuxconf &
  And select Networking->Client Tasks->Routing & Gateways->Set Other Routes to networks->Add network
  . Also select Networking->PPP

  bash# rp3 &
  bash# rp3-config &
  ______________________________________________________________________



  3.  Remote connection with VNC

  Once you have connection through PPP to remote machines, you can use
  the VNC to display remote machines on your local display.

  ·  The VNC is at   <http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc>

  ·  Get VNC rpms from rpmfind
     <http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=vnc>.


  ·  See also the List of X11 Windows Managers
     <http://www.dlhoffman.com/publiclibrary/RPM/X11_Window_Managers.html>.


  ·  The best Window manager for VNC is QVWM which is like MS Windows
     98/NT/2000 interface, get it from  <http://www.qvwm.org>.

  3.1.  Microsoft "MS Outlook" Email from PPP


  1. At office, start VNC server on your Windows NT/2000 desktop.

  2. Connect from home using modem via PPP.

  3. Once the PPP is established, you can start the vncviewer program.
     Just type /usr/bin/vncviewer.

  4. Enter your office Windows NT/2000 desktop's hostname and vnc
     password

  5. The entire desktop of your remote office Windows NT/2000 is
     displayed.  Now you can read your MS Outlook email.

     The document is written using a tool called "SGML-Tools" which can
     be got from: <http://www.sgmltools.org> Compiling the source you
     will get the following commands like:

  ·  sgml2html xxxxhowto.sgml     (to generate html file)

  ·  sgml2html -split 0   xxxxhowto.sgml (to generate a single page html
     file)

  ·  sgml2rtf  xxxxhowto.sgml     (to generate RTF file)

  ·  sgml2latex xxxxhowto.sgml    (to generate latex file)

  5.1.  Acrobat PDF format

  A PDF file can be generated from postscript file using either acrobat
  distill or Ghostscript.  And a postscript file is generated from DVI
  which in turn is generated from a LaTex file.  You can download
  distill software from  <http://www.adobe.com> and from unix
  <http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/acdunix.htm> and from windows
  <http://www.adobe.com:80/support/downloads/acdwin.htm> . Given below
  is a sample session:

  ______________________________________________________________________
  bash$ man sgml2latex
  bash$ sgml2latex filename.sgml
  bash$ man dvips
  bash$ dvips -o filename.ps filename.dvi
  bash$ distill filename.ps
  bash$ man ghostscript
  bash$ man ps2pdf
  bash$ ps2pdf input.ps output.pdf
  bash$ acroread output.pdf &
  ______________________________________________________________________


  Or you can use the Ghostscript command ps2pdf.  ps2pdf is a work-alike
  for nearly all the functionality of Adobe's Acrobat Distiller product:
  it converts PostScript files to Portable Document Format (PDF) files.
  ps2pdf is implemented as a very small command script (batch file) that
  invokes Ghostscript, selecting a special "output device" called
  pdfwrite. In order to use ps2pdf, the pdfwrite device must be included
  in the makefile when Ghostscript was compiled; see the documentation
  on building Ghostscript for details.

  5.2.  Convert Linuxdoc to Docbook format

  This document is written in linuxdoc SGML format. The Docbook SGML
  format supercedes the linuxdoc format and has a lot more features than
  linuxdoc.  The linuxdoc is very simple and easy to use. To convert
  linuxdoc SGML file to Docbook SGML use the program ld2db.sh and some
  Perl scripts.  The ld2db output is not 100% clean and you need to use
  the clean_ld2db.pl Perl script. You may need to manually correct a few
  lines in the document.

  ·  Download the ld2db program from
     <http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~rrt/docbook.html> or from Al Dev site
     <http://www.aldev.8m.com/cppsrc.html>

  ·  Download the cleanup_ld2db.pl perl script from from Al Dev site
     <http://www.aldev.8m.com/cppsrc.html>

     The ld2db.sh is not 100% clean, so you will get some errors when
     you run it.

     ___________________________________________________________________
             bash$ ld2db.sh file-linuxdoc.sgml db.sgml
             bash$ cleanup.pl db.sgml > db_clean.sgml
             bash$ gvim db_clean.sgml
             bash$ docbook2html db.sgml
     ___________________________________________________________________


  And you may have to manually edit some of the minor errors after run­
  ning the Perl script. For example you may need to put closing tag <
  /Para> for each < Listitem>

  5.3.  Convert to MS WinHelp format

  You can convert the SGML howto document to a Microsoft Windows Help
  file, First convert the sgml to html using:

  ______________________________________________________________________
          bash$ sgml2html xxxxhowto.sgml     (to generate html file)
          bash$ sgml2html -split 0   xxxxhowto.sgml (to generate a single page html file)
  ______________________________________________________________________


  Then use the tool HtmlToHlp <http://javadocs.planetmirror.com/html­
  tohlpe.html>.  You can also use sgml2rtf and then use the RTF files
  for generating winhelp files.

  5.4.  Reading various formats

  In order to view the document in dvi format, use the xdvi program. The
  xdvi program is located in tetex-xdvi*.rpm package in Redhat Linux
  which can be located through ControlPanel | Applications | Publishing
  | TeX menu buttons.  To read a dvi document give the command:


               xdvi -geometry 80x90 howto.dvi
               man xdvi



  And resize the window with the mouse.  To navigate use Arrow keys,
  Page Up, Page Down keys, also you can use 'f', 'd', 'u', 'c', 'l',
  'r', 'p', 'n' letter keys to move up, down, center, next page, previ­
  ous page etc.  To turn off expert menu press 'x'.

  You can read a postscript file using the program 'gv' (ghostview) or
  The ghostscript program is in the ghostscript*.rpm package and the gv
  program is in the gv*.rpm package in Redhat Linux which can be located
  through ControlPanel | Applications | Graphics menu buttons. The gv
  program is much more user friendly than ghostscript.  Also ghostscript
  and gv are available on other platforms like OS/2, Windows 95 and NT.
  You  can view this document even on those platforms.

  ·  Get ghostscript for Windows 95, OS/2, and for all OSes from
     <http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost>

  To read a postscript document give the command:


                       gv howto.ps
                       ghostscript howto.ps



  You can read an HTML format document using Netscape Navigator,
  Microsoft Internet explorer, Redhat Baron Web browser or any of the 10
  other web browsers.

  You can read the latex, LyX output using LyX an X Window front end to
  LaTex.

  5.5.  Convert HTML to SGML html2sgml

  To convert any HTML document to Linuxdoc SGML use the tool 'html2sgml'
  from  <http://www.abc.se/~m9339/prog/html2sgml.html>.

  7.  Appendix A Connecting Linux + PPP < -- >  NT + RAS...

  This section is written by John Newbigin, Email: jn@it.swin.edu.au
  Below is extract from
  <http://uranus.it.swin.edu.au/~jn/linux/ppp/linuxppp.htm>

  See also PPP HOWTO <http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/PPP-
  HOWTO/index.html>


  ·  Part 1... The easy bit : Use minicom or your favourite terminal
     program to dial the NT RAS Server. Once you have a connection you
     can proceed to Part 2. Make sure you can quit your terminal without
     resetting the modem.



  ·  Part 2... The harder bit : Setting up the /etc/ppp/options file may
     be a bit tricky. The important things to do are...  Make sure you
     do not have any of the following entries:

  ·  auth #This will demand that the NT machine authenticate it's self
     to your machine, this is generally not possible, or needed



  ·  +pap #This will demand that the NT machine authenticates it's self
     using PAP, see above



  ·  -pap #This says that you won't agree to use PAP


  ·  +chap #This will demand that the NT machine authenticates it's self
     using CHAP, see above


     Make sure the RAS server will accept plain text passwords. You need
     this to use PAP authentication. This can be set by going to Control
     Panel -> Network -> Services -> Remote Access Service ->
     Properties. Select the modem or dial up device, go to Network ->
     Server Settings -> Encryption Settings and select "allow any
     authentication including plain text". Then hit OK, Save etc. to
     close it all.



  ·  Part 3... The hardest bit (without this document) : NOTE: If you
     use my pppd patch, you will not have to do this

     In the /etc/ppp/pap-secretes file, add the following lines:


     ___________________________________________________________________
     "" * ""
     "jn" * "MyPassword"
     ___________________________________________________________________



  Where jn is your user name on the NT machine. But what if you are a
  member of a domain? Then use this instead (where csse-mm is replaced
  with your domain name)

  ______________________________________________________________________
  "" * ""
  "csse-mm\\jn" * "MyPassword"
  ______________________________________________________________________



  Note that you must escape the "\" character as "\\". then, back to the
  /etc/ppp/options file and add the following line:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  name "jn"
  or
  name "csse-mm\\jn"
  ______________________________________________________________________



  depending what you put in the pap-secretes file.



  ·  Part 4... Another easy bit : Dial in to the server, like in step
     one, or using your custom script. Start ppp with the following
     line:

     pppd 115200 /dev/cua1

     or whatever your settings might be.

     You may want to enable debug information if something does not
     work, but everything should.

     Run "ifconfig" and you should see an entry for ppp0. If you do then
     you are cooking with gas. Restart pppd using the "defaultroute"
     option and start surfing the internet.

     If you are still having trouble, or can't understand any of these
     instructions, drop me an e-mail
