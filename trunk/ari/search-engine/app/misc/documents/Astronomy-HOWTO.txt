  1.  Introduction

  1.1.  Knowledge Required

  With all the help from major Linux distributions such as SuSE, Redhat,
  Caldera and many others, Linux based systems are becoming easier to
  use.  However, there is still some need of understanding of basic UNIX
  skills to make the most of Linux.  Thus, this HOWTO will assume that
  the reader has at least a basic knowledge of using a UNIX system
  including the ability to compile and install programs.

  A few resources we have found useful over the years include:


  ·  "A Practical Guide to the UNIX System", Mark G. Sobel

  ·  "Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment", the late W. Richard
     Stevens

  ·  "Running LINUX", Matt Welsh et al.

  ·  "LINUX Device Drivers", Alessandro Rubini

  Similarly, this is not a tutorial or reference for astronomy
  principles or astronomical instrumentation. Astronomy is perhaps the
  grandest of all sciences, employing widely disparate disciplines in a
  bold attempt to understand nothing less than the universe itself. Your
  interests will lead in many directions. A few references we have used
  include:


  ·  "Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac", P. Kenneth
     Seidelmann

  ·  "Astronomy with your Personal Computer", Peter Duffett-Smith

  ·  "Astronomy on the Personal Computer", Oliver Montenbruck et al

  ·  "Textbook on Spherical Astronomy", W. M. Smart

  ·  "The Astronomy and Astrophysics Encyclopedia", Stephen P. Maran,
     ed.


  1.2.  Scope

  The authors define the scope of this HOWTO as primarily an index to
  Linux tools applicable in some fashion to the pursuit of Astronomy. It
  is NOT our intention to list WWW astronomy references in general. Our
  own interests tend more towards the technology than the pure science
  and so we welcome contributions from others who have found Linux tools
  which contribute in other ways to Astronomy. Please contact us at the
  address above.

  few links to sites which offer fully operational tools running online
  that we feel are especially useful or interesting, from a browser on
  any platform.

  4.  Astronomical Images over the web

  Much effort exists to allow access to Astronomical image file type
  such as FITS from any web browser.  Here are some pointers.


  4.1.  List

  The folks at harvard have a list of Image Servers and Image Browsers.


  ·  Astronomical Images Over the Web <http://tdc-
     www.harvard.edu/astro.image.html>


  5.  Organizations


  ·  The yearly Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems, ADAAS,
     <http://hea-www.harvard.edu/adass> Conference Series provides a
     forum for scientists and computer specialists concerned with
     algorithms, software and operating systems in the acquisition,
     reduction and analysis of astronomical data.  The program includes
     invited talks, contributed papers and poster sessions as well as
     user group meetings and special interest meetings ("BOFs'').  All
     these activities aim to encourage communication between software
     specialists and users, and also to stimulate further development of
     astronomical software and systems.

  ·  The linuxastro mailing list, linuxastro@majordomo.cv.nrao.edu, is
     for people who are interested in porting astronomical software to
     linux.  For more information, see linuxastro
     <http://bima.astro.umd.edu/nemo/linuxastro>.


  6.  Hardware Control

  More folks are using Linux to control equipment.  Users range from
  amateur astronomers in the field to professional observatories.


  6.1.  Telescope Control


  ·  OCAAS <http://www.torusoptics.com/OCAAS.htm> is a complete
     Observatory Control and Astronomical Analysis System for Linux.

  ·  XEphem <http://clearskyinstitute.com/xephem> has the capability to
     communicate with a telescope control daemon process.



  6.2.  CCD Camera Control


  ·  Apogee Instruments Inc <http://www.apogee-ccd.com/software.html>
     supports their line of professional CCD cameras under Linux.

  ·  SBIG <http://www.sbig.com/sbwhtmls/linux_announcement.htm> offers
     some assistance with operating their ST7 and ST8 CCD cameras under
     Linux.
  ·  CCD Astronomy on Linux <http://dimensional.com/~ashe/ccd-
     astro.html> These pages describe a number of facets of using
     astronomical CCD cameras for image acquisition and processing under
     Linux.


  7.  Installation Help

  You need to know what you're doing with Linux and installing programs,
  but help is available for some programs.  Here are some ways to make
  life easier.


  ·  AstroMake <http://bima.astro.umd.edu/nemo/linuxastro/astromake/> is
     is a utility intended to make installations of some common
     astronomical packages (in binary form) easy.

  ·  XEphem requires several elements to exist on your machine.  Life is
     much simpler with the CDROM version of the program as it contains
     an installation script which loads the appropriate precompiled
     binary for most systems and places all auxiliary files to the
     correct spots. See XEphem CDROM
     <http://www.clearskyinstitute.com/ecommerce/xephem/order.html>


  8.  Projects using Linux

  Here is a list of astronomy projects using Linux in whole or in part
  of their instrumentation:


  ·  The CHARA Array <http://www.chara.gsu.edu/CHARA/index.html> is an
     optical interferometer project using Linux in their control system.

  ·  CAOS <http://www.eso.org/projects/caos> Club of Amateurs in Optical
     Spectroscopy.
