  This document describes how to make your own CDs from the Red Hat
  Linux distribution equivalent to the ones commercially available from
  Red Hat.  The structure of the distribution is described, as well as
  the procedure needed to include updated RPMS into the distribution.
  Prerequisites are a good network connection, and a CD-writer.

  1.  Introduction


  There may be several reasons for making your own CD. Perhaps you're a
  cheapskate and want to save the $50 cost of the Red Hat distribution
  <http://www.redhat.com/>. Or, perhaps you want a distribution CD
  containing the latest distribution with all current updates. This is
  highly relevant, because after each major release of the Red Hat
  distribution, there have been loads of updates, several of which are
  security related. Just take a look at the errata page
  <http://www.redhat.com/corp/support/errata>.


  2.  Anatomy of the Red Hat FTP site


  In the spirit of the Linux community, Red Hat Software has made
  available their Linux distributions for several platforms on their FTP
  site. These are all available from the top distribution directory.


  2.1.  The top level directory


  The toplevel directory for RedHat Linux release 6.1
  (pub/redhat/redhat-6.1 <ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/redhat-6.1/>)
  contains distributions for the different platforms, and a directory
  containing updates and corrections to program packages that have been
  published since the release.



       SRPMS/     alpha/     i386/      sparc/      iso/



  In this document, we use the i386 distribution as an example.  The
  procedure given in this document is likely to work on all platforms
  supported by Red Hat (Alpha, SPARC, ppc, etc.), but we have only
  tested it on the i386 platform (the authors would be most interested
  in additional information). The root of the i386 directory looks like
  this:



       -rw-r--r--   1 root     root    18391  Mar 19  1999   COPYING
       -rw-r--r--   1 root     root     3409  Sep 26 01:12   README
       -rw-r--r--   1 root     root     1908  Sep 25 18:20   RPM-GPG-KEY
       drwxr-xr-x   5 root     root     4096  Oct 26 09:01   RedHat/
       -rwxr-xr-x   1 root     root      538  Sep 26 04:16   autorun
       -rwxr--r--   1 root     root     2048  Sep 30 20:00   boot.cat
       drwxr-xr-x   7 root     root     4096  Oct 26 09:01   doc/
       drwxr-xr-x   6 root     root     4096  Oct 26 09:01   dosutils/
       drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root     4096  Oct 26 09:01   images/
       -rw-r--r--   1 root     root   391123  Jan  5 09:05   ls-lR
       -rw-r--r--   1 root     root    51786  Jan  5 09:05   ls-lR.gz
       drwxr-xr-x   4 root     root     4096  Oct 26 09:01   misc/



  The doc directory contains an abundance of information. Most
  importantly, the RedHat installation manual can be found in HTML
  format in the directory doc/rhmanual/manual/
  <http://www.redhat.com/support/manuals/RHL-6.1-Manual/install-guide/>.
  Next, there is a number of FAQs, and finally, the entire collection of
  HOWTOs and mini-HOWTOs.

  The images directory contains boot floppy images that must be copied
  to a diskette. In the most recent distribution (6.1), there are two
  disk images available. The boot image is called boot.img, which is
  required when installation is performed directly from a CD-ROM.  If
  installation from a local hard disk, NFS mounted disk or FTP is
  required, the supplementary disk image supp.img might be needed. See
  section ``Installing from the CD'' and references therein for details.

  The misc directory contains source and executables of a number of
  programs needed for the installation. Finally, the iso directory
  contains iso9660 images just like the one you we about to make.



  2.2.  The "RedHat" directory -- the core of the distribution


  The most important part of the directory tree is rooted in the RedHat
  directory:



       drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root    28672   Oct 26 09:01   RPMS
       drwxr-xr-x   2 root     root     4096   Oct 26 09:01   base
       -rw-r--r--   1 root     root        0   Jan 19  1999   i386
       drwxr-xr-x   6 root     root     4096   Oct 26 09:01   instimage



  The RPMS directory contains the major part of the Red Hat distribution
  consisting of a set of RPM (Redhat Package Manager) files. An RPM
  package typically contains binary executables, along with relevant
  configuration files and documentation. See the section ``RPM
  packages'' for more information.

  The base directory holds different book-keeping files needed during
  the installation process, e.g. the comps file, which defines the
  components (groups of packages) used during the "Choose packages to
  install" phase.  See section ``The comps file'' for more information
  on this file, and how to use it.  Another important file in the base
  directory is the hdlist file containing most of the header fields from
  all the RPMs in the RPMS directory.

  This means that all the interdependencies among RPM packages can be
  determined just by reading hdlist without having to read all the RPM
  packages which is quite convenient especially during FTP installs.

  Another use of hdlist is mapping package names to file name, eg. perl
  to perl-5.004-6.i386.rpm.  This means that if you want to incorporate
  updates from RedHat (see section ``Incorporating the updates'') or add
  your own packages to the RPMS directory, you need to update hdlist.
  This is descriped later in ``Generating a new hdlist file''.

  The instimage directory contains a bare-bones live file system with a
  number of programs and shared libraries needed during the installation
  procedure.
  2.3.  The "updates" directory


  The /pub/redhat/updates directory has updates for all releases of
  RedHat's distribution since version 3.0.3. This is the place to find
  software packages that have been uppdated for some reason or other.
  You should especially be aware of security updates. These are
  publicised on RedHat's errata page whenever a fix is available. The
  most important files found in the updates directory are:



       drwxrwxr-x   8 ftpuser  ftpusers      8192 Aug 18 08:05 5.1/
       drwxrwxr-x   9 ftpuser  ftpusers      8192 Sep 18 08:07 5.2/
       drwxrwxr-x   9 ftpuser  ftpusers      8192 Jan  7 23:09 6.0/
       drwxrwxr-x   9 ftpuser  ftpusers      8192 Jan  7 23:09 6.1/
       lrwxrwxrwx   1 ftpuser  ftpusers      3 Aug 25 13:14 current -> 6.1/



  The structure of each of these directories is similar to that
  described in section ``The top level directory''



  3.  RPM packages


  The major part of the Red Hat distribution consists of a set of RPM
  (Redhat Package Manager) files.  An RPM package typically contains
  binary executables, along with relevant configuration files and
  documentation.  The rpm <http://www.rpm.org> program is a powerful
  package manager, which can be used to install, query, verify, update,
  erase and build software packages in the RPM format. Rpm convieniently
  maintains a database of all the software packages it has installed, so
  information on the installed software is available at any time.

  The binary RPM files in the distribution have been built on a system
  running the distribution itself. This is important, because most of
  the programs in the packages rely on shared libraries. From RedHat
  version 5.0, the new version 2 of the GNU standard C library (which is
  64-bit clean) has been used. This version of the library is commonly
  referred to as glibc or in Linux: libc 6. All executables in the
  distribution have been linked against this library. If you attempt to
  install binary files from a different distribution, chances are that
  they will not work, unless you install the libc5 package for backwards
  compability.

  The names of the RPM packages contain the suffix .arch.rpm, where arch
  is the architechture, having the value i386 for Intel platform
  binaries.  The packages you install must match the versions of the
  shared libraries available on the machine. The rpm
  <http://www.rpm.org> program is usually quite good at ensuring that
  this is indeed the case, however, there are ways around this check,
  and you should be sure that you know what you are doing if you force
  installation of packages this way.  However, using the RedHat
  installation boot disk, it is ensured that the correct set of RPM
  packages are installed on the machine.

  If you discover an RPM package that was not installed on your system
  during the installation process, don't despair. At any time, you may
  (as root) install RPM packages, for example:


       rpm --install  WindowMaker-0.18-1b.i386.rpm



  You can even install directly from the Internet, if you know the URL
  of an RPM package:



       rpm --install ftp://rufus.w3.org/redhat-contrib/noarch/mirror-2.9-2.noarch.rpm



  Another version of the RPM packages contain the original sources used
  to build the binaries. These packages have the suffix .src.rpm and are
  situated in the SRPMS directory. These packages are not needed on the
  installation CD, and in fact, there is not even enough disk space on
  an 74 minute burnable CD to accomodate them. Of course, you can make a
  separate CD with the SRPMS.



  4.  Obtaining your local copy of the distribution


  You need a copy of the distribution on a writable disk which is
  accessible from the computer having the CD writer (duh!). If you want
  to incorporate the latest updates, this directory should (also) be
  accessible from from a Linux machine, either from a local disk, an NFS
  mounted disk on a different computer, or a JAZ disk.

  You could copy the distribution from a RedHat CD, or you could get it
  via FTP. If you choose to use FTP, the best way to get a correct copy
  of the distribution is to use the mirror package.

  Mirror is a sophisticated perl script that compares the content of a
  directory on a remote site with a local directory. It will use FTP to
  fetch the files that are on the remote site but not the local site,
  and delete files on the local site that are not on the remote site.
  The mirror program is configured with a configuration file.  The
  mirror package is available as an RPM from rufus.w3.org
  <http://rufus.w3.org/linux/RPM/mirror.html>.

  Make your local copy mirror.redhat of the mirror configuration file,
  and edit the relevant fields at the top of the file. After the default
  section, define these packages:



       package=updates
               site=ftp.sunsite.auc.dk
               exclude_patt=(alpha/|sparc/|SRPMS/)
               remote_dir=/disk1/ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/updates/6.1
               local_dir=/jaz/updates/6.1

       package=dist
               site=ftp.sunsite.auc.dk
               exclude_patt=(alpha/|sparc/|SRPMS/|iso/)
               remote_dir=/disk1/ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/redhat-6.1
               local_dir=/jaz/redhat-6.1

  The following command will download a copy of the entire RedHat tree
  on your local disk. *Think* before you do this, you are about to
  transfer approximately 500Mb of data!



       mirror -pdist mirror.redhat



  This will mirror the Red Hat FTP site on your local disk. The content
  of a Red Hat distribution does not change between releases, so you
  only need to download this package ONCE. All changes to the
  distribution are in the updates directory. Thus, if you want to keep
  an up-to-date mirror of the Red Hat distribution, you only need to
  keep the updates directory current. This is done using the command



       mirror -pupdates mirror.redhat



  You can run this regularly, say, once a week, through a cron script.
  The RedHat distribution is available on a great number of FTP servers
  around the world, which are updated daily from the master site at
  <ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub>. You should choose an FTP site close to
  you, see the RedHat list of mirror sites
  <http://www.redhat.com/download/mirror.html>.


  5.  Incorporating the updates


  To incorporate the updates, you need write access to the distribution
  directory from a Linux machine, with a working version of rpm
  <http://www.rpm.org> installed. There are three steps involved:


  1. Correct the file protection modes.

  2. Replace updated RPMs.

  3. Generate the hdlist file

  If you maintain a mirror of the updates directory, you can at any time
  produce a CD including the current updates by repeating these steps.


  5.1.  Correcting the file protection modes


  During the installation process, some programs are run directly off
  the CD.  Unfortunately, the FTP program does not always preserve the
  protection modes of the files and directories that are copied.
  Therefore, it is necessary to make sure that execute permission is
  given to programs, shell scripts and shared libraries, before the
  directory is burned on the CD. This is done by running the updatePerm
  script on your local copy of the distribution:



  ______________________________________________________________________
  #!/bin/bash

  RHVERSION=6.1

  LIST=/tmp/er3hd3w25
  RHROOT=/jaz/redhat-${RHVERSION}

  # Find all directories, and make sure they have +x permission
  find $RHROOT -type d -exec chmod -c 755 {} \;

  # Find all files that are executables, shell, python or perl scripts
  find $RHROOT -type f | file -f - | grep -v RPM \
     | egrep -i 'executable|perl|bourne|shell|python' | cut -f1 -d: > $LIST
  #   ====>     NEEDED FOR RedHat 6.1        ^^^^^^^

  # Find shared libraries
  find $RHROOT -name \*.so >> $LIST

  # Make them executable
  while read file
  do
     if [ ! -x $file ] ; then
        chmod -c 755 $file
     fi
  done < $LIST

  /bin/rm $LIST

  exit 0
  ______________________________________________________________________



  5.2.  Replacing the updated RPMS


  The following script called updateCD copies all files from the update
  directory to the RPMS directory. The script uses some nifty rpm tricks
  to determine what packages in the updates directory are more recent.
  Older packages are moved to the ${OLD} directory.



  ______________________________________________________________________
  #! /bin/bash
  # This script updates rpms in a RedHat distribution found in $RPMDIR.
  # The old rpms will be placed in $OLDDIR.
  # The new rpms should be located in $UPDDIR.
  # The new images are in $IMGDIR
  # The images to be updated are in $OMGDIR
  # The architechture is $ARCH.

  RHVERSION=6.1
  ARCH=i386

  RHROOT=/jaz/redhat-${RHVERSION}
  RPMDIR=${RHROOT}/${ARCH}/RedHat/RPMS
  UPDDIR=${RHROOT}/updates/${ARCH}
  IMGDIR=${RHROOT}/updates/images/${ARCH}
  OMGDIR=${RHROOT}/${ARCH}/images
  OLDDIR=${RHROOT}/old

  if [ ! -d $OLDDIR ] ; then
     echo making directory $OLDDIR
     mkdir $OLDDIR
  fi

  allow_null_glob_expansion=1

  for rpm in ${UPDDIR}/*.rpm ; do
    NAME=`rpm --queryformat "%{NAME}" -qp $rpm`
    unset OLDNAME
    for oldrpm in ${RPMDIR}/${NAME}*.rpm ; do
      if [ `rpm --queryformat "%{NAME}" -qp $oldrpm` = "$NAME" ]; then
        OLDNAME=$oldrpm;
        break
      fi
    done
    if [ -z "$OLDNAME" ]; then
      echo $NAME is new
      cp -pv $rpm $RPMDIR
    else
      if [ `basename $rpm` != `basename $OLDNAME` ]; then
        mv $OLDNAME $OLDDIR
        cp -pv $rpm $RPMDIR
      fi
    fi
  done


  # Copy new boot image files to the right place...
  for newfile in ${IMGDIR}/* ; do
    file=${OMGDIR}/$(basename ${newfile})
    if [ $newfile -nt $file ] ; then
       cp -pv $newfile $file
    fi
  done

  exit 0
  ______________________________________________________________________



  5.2.1.  Important note for RedHat 6.0, 6.1



  Certain RPMs, specifically the kernel and kernel-smp packages, include
  the platform in the filename but not in the package name.  For
  example, the "kernel" package comes in several flavors:



       kernel-2.2.5-22.i386.rpm
       kernel-2.2.5-22.i586.rpm
       kernel-2.2.5-22.i686.rpm



  but for all three rpm -qp returns just "kernel" for the package name.

  As you can see, this "outsmarts" the updateCD script.  The result is
  that only the last one gets properly copied.  The first two get
  copied, but are then moved to the $OLD directory! Preferably, RedHat
  should name these differently.  But for now, the easy solution is to
  move the packages by hand, after running updateCD.  (Thanks to Kyle B.
  Ferrio <kyle@U.Arizona.EDU>)

  Joshua Sarro <mthed@shore.net> has contributed a perl script called
  updateMirror.pl which can deal with the situation. You can fetch it
  here:  <http://imsb.au.dk/~mok/linux/doc/updateMirror.pl>.



  5.3.  Generating a new hdlist file


  When installing from the CD, the installation program on the CD relies
  on the file RedHat/base/hdlist describing what RPM packages are
  available on the CD. The hdlist file can be generated by the program
  misc/src/install/genhdlist.  This program must be run with the
  absolute path to the root of the distribution as the only argument.
  Here is the updateHdlist script which calls that program:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  #!/bin/bash

  RHVERSION=6.1
  ARCH=i386

  echo generating hdlist...
  RHROOT=/jaz/redhat-${RHVERSION}
  GENHDDIR=${RHROOT}/${ARCH}/misc/src/install

  chmod u+x ${GENHDDIR}/genhdlist
  chmod 644 ${RHROOT}/${ARCH}/RedHat/base/hdlist
  ${GENHDDIR}/genhdlist ${RHROOT}/${ARCH} || echo "*** GENHDLIST FAILED ***"

  exit 0
  ______________________________________________________________________



  NOTE: After having incorporated the updates in the main RedHat/RPMS
  directory, your copy of the distribution is no longer a mirror of the
  Red Hat distribution site. Actually, it is more up-to-date! Therefore,
  if you attempt to mirror the distribution, older versions of the RPM's
  that have been updated will be downloaded once more, and the updates
  deleted.
  5.3.1.  Important note for RedHat 6.1


  The installation in RedHat 6.1 is completely changed from earlier
  versions, and RedHat have introduced a system called ``anaconda''. The
  genhdlist program is now found in a different place, so in the script
  above, use


  ______________________________________________________________________
  GENHDDIR=${RHROOT}/${ARCH}/misc/src/anaconda/utils
  ______________________________________________________________________



  The updatePerm script must be changed to include ``python'' in line
  13. This has been done in the listing above, but if you've cut the
  script from earlier versions of this document (before 1.30), you need
  to make the change!

  In some cases, genhdlist fails to run, because the executable is not
  statically linked. In such a case, you can add a new line
  ${RHROOT}/${ARCH}/RedHat/instimage/usr/lib in /etc/ld.so.conf and run
  ldconfig -v.

  Another solution is to recompile genhdlist. The following modification
  to the updateHdlist script worked under RedHat 5.2:


  ______________________________________________________________________
  #!/bin/bash

  RHVERSION=6.1
  ARCH=i386

  RHROOT=/misc/redhat/redhat-${RHVERSION}
  GENHDDIR=${RHROOT}/${ARCH}/misc/src/anaconda/utils

  echo Compiling genhdlist...
  sed -e 's/FD_t/int/' \
      -e 's/fdOpen/open/' \
      -e 's/fdClose/close/' \
      -e 's/fdFileno//' < ${GENHDDIR}/genhdlist.c > /tmp/genhdlist.c
  cc -o /tmp/genhdlist -I/usr/include/rpm /tmp/genhdlist.c -lrpm -lz

  echo generating hdlist...
  chmod 644 ${RHROOT}/${ARCH}/RedHat/base/hdlist
  /tmp/genhdlist ${RHROOT}/${ARCH} || echo "*** GENHDLIST FAILED ***"

  exit 0
  ______________________________________________________________________



  In this version of the script, a copy of the C source of genhdlist.c
  is piped through sed to create a copy in /tmp that will compile under
  RedHat 5.2.  This version of genhdlist is then used to create the
  hdlist file


  5.3.2.  Important note for RedHat 5.2


  As distributed with RedHat version 5.2 and earlier, genhdlist CRASHES
  if there are files in the RedHat/RPMS directory which are not RPM
  files!  This causes problems, because in the 5.2 distribution, there
  are a couple of non-RPM files named ls-lR and ls-lR.gz in RedHat/RPMS.
  Therefore, you must remove all non-RPM files from the directory.
  Alternatively, you can apply the following patch to
  misc/src/install/genhdlist.c and do a make. The patch will cause
  genhdlist to ignore any non-RPM files.

  5.4.  Thecomps file


  The comps file defines how the packages are bundled during the
  installation.  In the Red Hat distribution, this is done according to
  the functionality they provide, for example:


  ¬∑  Printer Support

  ¬∑  X Window System

  ¬∑  GNOME

  ¬∑  KDE

  ¬∑  Mail/WWW/News Tools

  ¬∑  ...

  ¬∑  Kernel Development

  ¬∑  Extra Documentation

  Sometime during the installation process, the user is presented with a
  dialog called "Components to install". Some of the components have
  been preselected, and others not. The last item on the components list
  is called "Everything".  According to the Red Hat documentation,
  selecting every package will require close to 1 Gb of free disk space.

  On the dialog box, there also is an option that enables the user to
  customize exactly what packages will be installed.  Customizing the
  installation by hand, or selecting "Everything" in the components list
  is the only way to have your own packages installed unless you modify
  the RedHat/base/comps file.


  5.4.1.  Format of comps file in RedHat versions < 6.1


  The format of the comps file currently starts with a header describing
  the version of the comps format, followed by an empty line.



       0.1
       <empty line>



  After this, the components are listed, separated by empty lines:



       <component 1>
       <empty line>
       <component 2>
       <empty line>
       .
       .
       <component n>
       <empty line>
       EOF


  Each component has the following definition:



       (0|1) (--hide)? <name>
       <RPM 1>
       <RPM 2>
       ...
       <RPM n>
       end



  Before the name of each component, 0 or 1 is given. A value of 1 here
  means that the component is chosen by default, and 0 means it's not.
  The option "--hide" means that you will not see the entry, unless you
  choose "expert" installation. The first component is called "Base",
  and that is special, in the sense that it must be present and it does
  not show up in the dialog (you can't deselect the base installation,
  which makes sense...)

  Next follows a list of rpm packages belonging to that component. Note
  that this is the package name stored in the rpm file, and not any part
  of the file name of the package (although it is often the same).

  By adding your packages to the comps file, you can customize your own
  distribution, and make sure that your packages will be installed by
  default. One thing to be careful about is interdependence among your
  packages, but here, you are on your own :-) A word of warning: be
  careful not to add or remove extra whitespace in the file. Examine the
  existing comps file (make a copy of the original) to see how it's done
  (or check i386/misc/src/install/pkgs.c if you want to see how the file
  is parsed).


  5.4.2.  Format of comps file in RedHat version 6.1


  With RedHat version 6.1, the format of the comps file has changed. We
  have not yet disected it to discover the file format. With the above
  information, however, it should be easy enough to do it yourself. The
  decoding takes place in ${RHROOT}/${ARCH}/misc/src/anaconda/comps.py.



  6.  At last: burning the CD


  As we assume that you have a working CD-writer on your system, and you
  know how to use it, we wont go into much detail about burning the CD.
  If you are burning your CD on a Linux system, you can install the
  excellent XCDroast <http://www.fh-muenchen.de/rz/xcdroast> package.
  In XCDRoast, switch on the Rock Ridge extensions, and the creation of
  a TRANS.TBL file.

  Make sure the top directory of the CD contains at least the following
  files and directories:



       COPYING      RPM-PGP-KEY README       RedHat/



  The following directories might come in handy:



       doc/         gnome/      misc/        dosutils/    images/



  6.1.  Creating a bootable CD


  Since XCDroast doesn't support creation of bootable disks you'll need
  to use other tools, for example mkisofs
  <ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages/mkisofs/> (RPMs
  <http://rufus.w3.org/linux/RPM/mkisofs.html>).  and cdrecord
  <http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/cdrecord.html>.
  (RPMs <http://rufus.w3.org/linux/RPM/cdrecord.html>).  You'll need to
  create an image file which will be written to the CD. This file will
  be 500Mb or more so find a partition with enough free space and change
  the path for redhat.img in the following commands if necessary. You
  may need to be root to use mount and cdrecord.


  6.1.1.  Create iso9660 disk image


  Change directory to the place in your mirror that will be the root
  directory of the cd. For instance, redhat-6.1/i386.



       mkisofs -v -r -T -J -V "Red Hat 6.1" -b images/boot.img -c boot.catalog -o /tmp/redhat.img .



  The file ${RHROOT}/boot.catalog will be created by mkisofs.

  Some versions of mkisofs do not have a -J option.  It can be omitted
  since the Joliet extensions it specifies are not used by the installer
  although they make the CD more readable in Windows.



  6.1.2.  Test the image


  If you're paranoid you can test your new disk image by mounting it. If
  you forgot to fix the file permissions or set the rock ridge
  extensions then the error will be obvious here since the file names
  and directory structure will be wrong.



       mount -t iso9660 -o ro,loop=/dev/loop0 /tmp/redhat.img /mnt/cdrom


  When you're done, don't forget to unmount it.



       umount /mnt/cdrom



  6.1.3.  Burn the disk


  Be sure to set the correct speed for your device. This command is for
  a 4X CDR. You may have a 1X or 2X drive.



       cdrecord -v speed=4 dev=0,3 /tmp/redhat.img



  In the above command, it is assumed that the CD writer is on SCSI bus
  0, with ID number 3.


  7.  Installing from the CD


  When installing from the new CD, you may first need to create a
  bootable installation diskette. IMPORTANT: use a NEW, freshly MS-DOS
  formatted diskette! Using an old, worn-out, faulty diskette can result
  in strange problems during the installation!

  On a Linux system, you can create the diskette using the dd command:



       dd if=/mnt/cdrom/images/boot.img of=/dev/fd0 bs=1440k



  On a system running DOS or Windows-9x, you need to use the RAWRITE.EXE
  program, which is found on the CD in the dosutils directory.

  Shut down the machine you want to install (or do a system upgrade) on,
  insert the boot diskette and your freshly burned CD, and let the
  machine boot from the diskette. For more information on the
  installation process, se the documents and the Installation-HOWTO or
  the Bootdisk-HOWTO which are on the CD in the doc/HOWTO directory.


  7.1.  Booting from a bootable CD


  Most modern machines are able to boot directly from a CD, provided it
  is made bootable with the procedure outlined in section ``Creating a
  bootable CD''.  Often, however, you need to change the setting of the
  BIOS to make the CD drive bootable.  See the documentation for your
  mother board to see how it's done.


  8.  Other Linux distributions


  The information in this document also applies to other Linux
  distributions that are RedHat clones, such as Mandrake
  <http://www.linux-mandrake.com>, although we have not actually tried
  them ourself.  The Mandrake distributions uses a simpler hdgenlist
  program (it's a shell script), and other details may be different.

  The LinuxPPC <http://www.linuxppc.org> distribution for Apple
  PowerMacs and other PowerPPC machines is also somewhat similar to the
  RedHat distribution. When making a distribution for the PowerMac
  platform, you need to use mkhybrid
  <http://rufus.w3.org/linux/RPM/mkhybrid.html>) instead of mkisofs. We
  have not tried it, but we'd like to hear from people who have.

  let you check your Red Hat Linux distribution mirror for matching file
  sizes, names, permissions, and symlinks against an "ls -lNR" listing
  from the offical Red Hat ftp site. Any permissions that are wrong are
  changed to match the ls listing. See the fix-rhcd homepage
