  1.  What's New?

  Newer kernels have changed the interface a bit. This affects a section
  formerly entitled 'rescanning the devices'. Now it is possible to
  add/remove SCSI devices on the fly.

  Since kernel 1.3.98 some important header files have been moved/split
  (sg.h and scsi.h).

  Some stupid bugs have been replaced by newer ones.


  2.  Introduction

  This document is a guide to the installation and programming of the
  Linux generic SCSI interface.

  It covers kernel prerequisites, device mappings, and basic interaction
  with devices. Some simple C programming examples are included.
  General knowledge of the SCSI command set is required; for more
  information on the SCSI standard and related information, see the
  appendix to this document.

  Note the plain text version of this document lacks cross references
  (they show up as ``'').


  3.  What Is The Generic SCSI Interface?

  The generic SCSI interface has been implemented to provide general
  SCSI access to (possibly exotic) pieces of SCSI hardware. It was
  developed by Lawrence Foard ( entropy@world.std.com) and sponsored by
  Killy Corporation (see the comments in scsi/sg.h).

  The interface makes special device handling possible from user level
  applications (i.e. outside the kernel). Thus, kernel driver
  development, which is more risky and difficult to debug, is not
  necessary.

  However, if you don't program the driver properly it is possible to
  hang the SCSI bus, the driver, or the kernel. Therefore, it is
  important to properly program the generic driver and to first back up
  all files to avoid losing data. Another useful thing to do before
  running your programs is to issue a sync command to ensure that any
  buffers are flushed to disk, minimizing data loss if the system hangs.

  Another advantage of the generic driver is that as long as the
  interface itself does not change, all applications are independent of
  new kernel development. In comparison, other low-level kernel drivers
  have to be synchronized with other internal kernel changes.

  Typically, the generic driver is used to communicate with new SCSI
  hardware devices that require special user applications to be written
  to take advantage of their features (e.g. scanners, printers, CD-ROM
  jukeboxes). The generic interface allows these to be written quickly.

  4.  What Are The Requirements To Use It?


  4.1.  Kernel Configuration

  You must have a supported SCSI controller, obviously. Furthermore,
  your kernel must have controller support as well as generic support
  compiled in. Configuring the Linux kernel (via make config under
  /usr/src/linux) typically looks like the following:



        ...
       *
       * SCSI support
       *
       SCSI support? (CONFIG_SCSI) [n] y
       *
       * SCSI support type (disk, tape, CDrom)
       *
        ...
       Scsi generic support (CONFIG_CHR_DEV_SG) [n] y
       *
       * SCSI low-level drivers
       *
        ...



  If available, modules can of course be build instead.


  4.2.  Device Files

  The generic SCSI driver uses its own device files, separate from those
  used by the other SCSI device drivers. They can be generated using the
  MAKEDEV script, typically found in the /dev directory. Running MAKEDEV
  sg produces these files:



       crw-------   1 root     system    21,   0 Aug 20 20:09 /dev/sga
       crw-------   1 root     system    21,   1 Aug 20 20:09 /dev/sgb
       crw-------   1 root     system    21,   2 Aug 20 20:09 /dev/sgc
       crw-------   1 root     system    21,   3 Aug 20 20:09 /dev/sgd
       crw-------   1 root     system    21,   4 Aug 20 20:09 /dev/sge
       crw-------   1 root     system    21,   5 Aug 20 20:09 /dev/sgf
       crw-------   1 root     system    21,   6 Aug 20 20:09 /dev/sgg
       crw-------   1 root     system    21,   7 Aug 20 20:09 /dev/sgh
                                          |    |
                                      major,   minor device numbers



  Note that these are character devices for raw access. On some systems
  these devices may be called /dev/{sg0,sg1,...}, depending on your
  installation, so adjust the following examples accordingly.


  4.3.  Device Mapping

  These device files are dynamically mapped to SCSI id/LUNs on your SCSI
  bus (LUN = logical unit). The mapping allocates devices consecutively
  for each LUN of each device on each SCSI bus found at time of the SCSI
  scan, beginning at the lower LUNs/ids/buses. It starts with the first
  SCSI controller and continues without interruption with all following
  controllers. This is currently done in the initialisation of the SCSI
  driver.

  For example, assuming you had three SCSI devices hooked up with ids 1,
  3, and 5 on the first SCSI bus (each having one LUN), then the
  following mapping would be in effect:



       /dev/sga -> SCSI id 1
       /dev/sgb -> SCSI id 3
       /dev/sgc -> SCSI id 5



  If you now add a new device with id 4, then the mapping (after the
  next rescan) will be:



       /dev/sga -> SCSI id 1
       /dev/sgb -> SCSI id 3
       /dev/sgc -> SCSI id 4
       /dev/sgd -> SCSI id 5



  Notice the change for id 5 -- the corresponding device is no longer
  mapped to /dev/sgc but is now under /dev/sgd.

  Luckily newer kernels allow for changing this order.


  4.3.1.  Dynamically insert and remove SCSI devices

  If a newer kernel and the /proc file system is running, a non-busy
  device can be removed and installed 'on the fly'.

  To remove a SCSI device:


       echo "scsi remove-single-device a b c d" > /proc/scsi/scsi



  and similar, to add a SCSI device, do


       echo "scsi add-single-device a b c d" > /proc/scsi/scsi



  where


             a == hostadapter id (first one being 0)
             b == SCSI channel on hostadapter (first one being 0)
             c == ID
             d == LUN (first one being 0)

  So in order to swap the /dev/sgc and /dev/sgd mappings from the
  previous example, we could do



       echo "scsi remove-single-device 0 0 4 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi
       echo "scsi remove-single-device 0 0 5 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi
       echo "scsi add-single-device 0 0 5 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi
       echo "scsi add-single-device 0 0 4 0" > /proc/scsi/scsi



  since generic devices are mapped in the order of their insertion.

  When adding more devices to the scsi bus keep in mind there are
  limited spare entries for new devices. The memory has been allocated
  at boot time and has room for 2 more devices.


  5.  Programmers Guide

  The following sections are for programmers who want to use the generic
  SCSI interface in their own applications. An example will be given
  showing how to access a SCSI device with the INQUIRY and the
  TESTUNITREADY commands.


  When using these code examples, note the following:

  o  the location of the header files sg.h and scsi.h has changed in
     kernel version 1.3.98. Now these files are located at
     /usr/src/linux/include/scsi, which is hopefully linked to
     /usr/include/scsi. Previously they were in
     /usr/src/linux/drivers/scsi. We assume a newer kernel in the
     following text.

  o  the generic SCSI interface was extended in kernel version 1.1.68;
     the examples require at least this version. But please avoid kernel
     version 1.1.77 up to 1.1.89 and 1.3.52 upto 1.3.56 since they had a
     broken generic scsi interface.

  o  the constant DEVICE in the header section describing the accessed
     device should be set according to your available devices (see
     section ``''.


  6.  Overview Of Device Programming

  The header file include/scsi/sg.h contains a description of the
  interface (this is based on kernel version 1.3.98):



  struct sg_header
   {
    int pack_len;
                     /* length of incoming packet (including header) */
    int reply_len;   /* maximum length of expected reply */
    int pack_id;     /* id number of packet */
    int result;      /* 0==ok, otherwise refer to errno codes */
    unsigned int twelve_byte:1;
                 /* Force 12 byte command length for group 6 & 7 commands  */
    unsigned int other_flags:31;                  /* for future use */
    unsigned char sense_buffer[16]; /* used only by reads */
    /* command follows then data for command */
   };



  This structure describes how a SCSI command is to be processed and has
  room to hold the results of the execution of the command.  The
  individual structure components will be discussed later in section
  ``''.

  The general way of exchanging data with the generic driver is as
  follows: to send a command to an opened generic device, write() a
  block containing these three parts to it:



       struct sg_header
       SCSI command
       data to be sent with the command



  To obtain the result of a command, read() a block with this (similar)
  block structure:



       struct sg_header
       data coming from the device



  This is a general overview of the process. The following sections
  describe each of the steps in more detail.

  NOTE: Up to recent kernel versions, it is necessary to block the
  SIGINT signal between the write() and the corresponding read() call
  (i.e. via sigprocmask()). A return after the write() part without any
  read() to fetch the results will block on subsequent accesses. This
  signal blocking has not yet been included in the example code. So
  better do not issue SIGINT (a la ^C) when running these examples.


  7.  Opening The Device

  A generic device has to be opened for read and write access:

               int fd = open (device_name, O_RDWR);



  (This is the case even for a read-only hardware device such as a cdrom
  drive).

  We have to perform a write to send the command and a read to get back
  any results. In the case of an error the return code is negative (see
  section ``'' for a complete list).


  8.  The Header Structure



  The header structure struct sg_header serves as a controlling layer
  between the application and the kernel driver.  We now discuss its
  components in detail.



     int pack_len
        defines the size of the block written to the driver.  This is
        defined within the kernel for internal use.

     int reply_len
        defines the size of the block to be accepted at reply.  This is
        defined from the application side.


     int pack_id
        This field helps to assign replies to requests. The application
        can supply a unique id for each request. Suppose you have
        written several commands (say 4) to one device. They may work in
        parallel, one being the fastest. When getting replies via 4
        reads, the replies do not have to have the order of the
        requests. To identify the correct reply for a given request one
        can use the pack_id field. Typically its value is incremented
        after each request (and wraps eventually). The maximum amount of
        outstanding requests is limited by the kernel to SG_MAX_QUEUE
        (eg 4).


     int result
        the result code of a read or write call.  This is (sometimes)
        defined from the generic driver (kernel) side.  It is safe to
        set it to null before the write call.  These codes are defined
        in errno.h (0 meaning no error).


     unsigned int twelve_byte:1
        This field is necessary only when using non-standard vendor
        specific commands (in the range 0xc0 - 0xff).  When these
        commands have a command length of 12 bytes instead of 10, this
        field has to be set to one before the write call. Other command
        lengths are not supported. This is defined from the application
        side.


     unsigned char sense_buffer[16]
        This buffer is set after a command is completed (after a read()
        call) and contains the SCSI sense code. Some command results
        have to be read from here (e.g. for TESTUNITREADY). Usually it
        contains just zero bytes.  The value in this field is set by the
        generic driver (kernel) side.



  The following example function interfaces directly with the generic
  kernel driver. It defines the header structure, sends the command via
  write, gets the result via read and does some (limited) error
  checking.  The sense buffer data is available in the output buffer
  (unless a NULL pointer has been given, in which case it's in the input
  buffer). We will use it in the examples which follow.

  Note: Set the value of DEVICE to your device descriptor.



  #define DEVICE "/dev/sgc"

                             unsigned in_size,         /* input data size */
                             unsigned char *i_buff,    /* input buffer */

                             unsigned char *o_buff     /* output buffer */
                             )
  {
      int status = 0;
      struct sg_header *sg_hd;

      /* safety checks */
      if (!cmd_len) return -1;            /* need a cmd_len != 0 */
      if (!i_buff) return -1;             /* need an input buffer != NULL */
  #ifdef SG_BIG_BUFF
      if (SCSI_OFF + cmd_len + in_size > SG_BIG_BUFF) return -1;
      if (SCSI_OFF + out_size > SG_BIG_BUFF) return -1;
  #else
      if (SCSI_OFF + cmd_len + in_size > 4096) return -1;

      /* generic SCSI device header construction */
      sg_hd = (struct sg_header *) i_buff;
      sg_hd->reply_len   = SCSI_OFF + out_size;
      sg_hd->twelve_byte = cmd_len == 12;
      sg_hd->result = 0;
  #if     0

      sg_hd->other_flags; /* not used */
  #endif

      /* send command */
      status = write( fd, i_buff, SCSI_OFF + cmd_len + in_size );
      if ( status < 0 || status != SCSI_OFF + cmd_len + in_size ||
                         sg_hd->result ) {
          /* some error happened */
          fprintf( stderr, "write(generic) result = 0x%x cmd = 0x%x\n",
                      sg_hd->result, i_buff[SCSI_OFF] );
          perror("");
          return status;
      }

      if (!o_buff) o_buff = i_buff;       /* buffer pointer check */

      /* retrieve result */
      status = read( fd, o_buff, SCSI_OFF + out_size);
      if ( status < 0 || status != SCSI_OFF + out_size || sg_hd->result ) {
          /* some error happened */
          fprintf( stderr, "read(generic) status = 0x%x, result = 0x%x, "
                           "cmd = 0x%x\n",
                           status, sg_hd->result, o_buff[SCSI_OFF] );
          fprintf( stderr, "read(generic) sense "
                  "%x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x %x\n",
                  sg_hd->sense_buffer[0],         sg_hd->sense_buffer[1],
                  sg_hd->sense_buffer[2],         sg_hd->sense_buffer[3],
                  sg_hd->sense_buffer[4],         sg_hd->sense_buffer[5],
                  sg_hd->sense_buffer[6],         sg_hd->sense_buffer[7],
                  sg_hd->sense_buffer[8],         sg_hd->sense_buffer[9],
                  sg_hd->sense_buffer[10],        sg_hd->sense_buffer[11],
                  sg_hd->sense_buffer[12],        sg_hd->sense_buffer[13],
                  sg_hd->sense_buffer[14],        sg_hd->sense_buffer[15]);
          if (status < 0)
              perror("");
      }
      /* Look if we got what we expected to get */
      if (status == SCSI_OFF + out_size) status = 0; /* got them all */

      return status;  /* 0 means no error */
  }



  While this may look somewhat complex at first appearance, most of the
  code is for error checking and reporting (which is useful even after
  the code is working).

  Handle_SCSI_cmd has a generalized form for all SCSI commands types,
  falling into each of these categories:



              Data Mode              | Example Command
       ===============================================
       neither input nor output data | test unit ready
        no input data, output data   | inquiry, read
        input data, no output data   | mode select, write
          input data, output data    | mode sense



  9.  Inquiry Command Example

  One of the most basic SCSI commands is the INQUIRY command, used to
  identify the type and make of the device. Here is the definition from
  the SCSI-2 specification (for details refer to the SCSI-2 standard).

  The next example uses the low-level function handle_SCSI_cmd to
  perform the Inquiry SCSI command.

  We first append the command block to the generic header, then call
  handle_SCSI_cmd.  Note that the output buffer size argument for the
  handle_SCSI_cmd call excludes the generic header size.  After command
  completion the output buffer contains the requested data, unless an
  error occurred.



  #define INQUIRY_CMD     0x12
  #define INQUIRY_CMDLEN  6
  #define INQUIRY_REPLY_LEN 96
  #define INQUIRY_VENDOR  8       /* Offset in reply data to vendor name */

  /* request vendor brand and model */
  static unsigned char *Inquiry ( void )
  {
    unsigned char Inqbuffer[ SCSI_OFF + INQUIRY_REPLY_LEN ];
    unsigned char cmdblk [ INQUIRY_CMDLEN ] =
        { INQUIRY_CMD,  /* command */
                    0,  /* lun/reserved */
                    0,  /* page code */
                    0,  /* reserved */
    INQUIRY_REPLY_LEN,  /* allocation length */
                    0 };/* reserved/flag/link */

    memcpy( cmd + SCSI_OFF, cmdblk, sizeof(cmdblk) );

    /*
     * +------------------+
     * | struct sg_header | <- cmd
     * +------------------+
     * | copy of cmdblk   | <- cmd + SCSI_OFF
     * +------------------+
     */

    if (handle_SCSI_cmd(sizeof(cmdblk), 0, cmd,
                        sizeof(Inqbuffer) - SCSI_OFF, Inqbuffer )) {
        fprintf( stderr, "Inquiry failed\n" );
        exit(2);
    }
    return (Inqbuffer + SCSI_OFF);
  }



  The example above follows this structure. The Inquiry function copies
  its command block behind the generic header (given by SCSI_OFF). Input
  data is not present for this command.  Handle_SCSI_cmd will define the
  header structure. We can now implement the function main to complete
  this working example program.



       void main( void )
       {
         fd = open(DEVICE, O_RDWR);
         if (fd < 0) {
           fprintf( stderr, "Need read/write permissions for "DEVICE".\n" );
           exit(1);
         }

         /* print some fields of the Inquiry result */
         printf( "%s\n", Inquiry() + INQUIRY_VENDOR );
       }



  We first open the device, check for errors, and then call the higher
  level subroutine. Then we print the results in human readable format
  including the vendor, product, and revision.


  Note: There is more information in the Inquiry result than this little
  program gives. You may want to extend the program to give device type,
  ANSI version etc. The device type is of special importance, since it
  determines the mandatory and optional command sets for this device.
  If you don't want to program it yourself, you may want to use the
  scsiinfo program from Eric Youngdale, which requests nearly all
  information about an SCSI device. Look at tsx-11.mit.edu in
  pub/Linux/ALPHA/scsi.


  10.  The Sense Buffer


  Commands with no output data can give status information via the sense
  buffer (which is part of the header structure).  Sense data is
  available when the previous command has terminated with a CHECK
  CONDITION status. In this case the kernel automatically retrieves the
  sense data via a REQUEST SENSE command. Its structure is:

  Note: The most useful fields are Sense Key (see section ``''),
  Additional Sense Code and Additional Sense Code Qualifier (see section
  ``''). The latter two are used combined as a pair.


  11.  Example Using Sense Buffer

  Here we will use the TEST UNIT READY command to check whether media is
  loaded into our device. The header declarations and function
  handle_SCSI_cmd from the inquiry example will be needed as well.

  #define TESTUNITREADY_CMDLEN 6

  #define ADD_SENSECODE 12
  #define ADD_SC_QUALIFIER 13

  }



  Combined with this main function we can do the check.



       void main( void )
       {
         fd = open(DEVICE, O_RDWR);
         if (fd < 0) {
           fprintf( stderr, "Need read/write permissions for "DEVICE".\n" );
           exit(1);
         }

         /* look if medium is loaded */

         if (!TestForMedium()) {
           printf("device is unloaded\n");
         } else {
           printf("device is loaded\n");
         }
       }

  The file generic_demo.c from the appendix contains both examples.


  12.  Ioctl Functions


  There are two ioctl functions available:

  o  ioctl(fd, SG_SET_TIMEOUT, &Timeout); sets the timeout value to
     Timeout * 10 milliseconds. Timeout has to be declared as int.

  o  ioctl(fd, SG_GET_TIMEOUT, &Timeout); gets the current timeout
     value.  Timeout has to be declared as int.


  13.  Driver Defaults


  13.1.  Transfer Lengths


  Currently (at least up to kernel version 1.1.68) input and output
  sizes have to be less than or equal than 4096 bytes unless the kernel
  has been compiled with SG_BIG_BUFF defined, if which case it is
  limited to SG_BIG_BUFF (e.g. 32768) bytes.  These sizes include the
  generic header as well as the command block on input.  SG_BIG_BUFF can
  be safely increased upto (131072 - 512). To take advantage of this, a
  new kernel has to be compiled and booted, of course.


  13.2.  Timeout And Retry Values

  The default timeout value is set to one minute (Timeout = 6000).  It
  can be changed through an ioctl call (see section ``'').  The default
  number of retries is one.


  14.  Obtaining The Scsi Specifications

  There are standards entitled SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 (and possibly soon
  SCSI-3). The standards are mostly upward compatible.

  The SCSI-1 standard is (in the author's opinion) mostly obsolete, and
  SCSI-2 is the most widely used. SCSI-3 is very new and very expensive.
  These standardized command sets specify mandatory and optional
  commands for SCSI manufacturers and should be preferred over the
  vendor specific command extensions which are not standardized and for
  which programming information is seldom available. Of course sometimes
  there is no alternative to these extensions.

  15.1.  HOWTOs and FAQs

  The Linux SCSI-HOWTO by Drew Eckhardt covers all supported SCSI
  controllers as well as device specific questions. A lot of
  troubleshooting hints are given. It is available from sunsite.unc.edu
  in /pub/Linux/docs/LDP and its mirror sites.

  General questions about SCSI are answered in the SCSI-FAQ from the
  newsgroup Comp.Periphs.Scsi (available on tsx-11 in
  pub/linux/ALPHA/scsi and mirror sites).


  15.2.  Mailing list

  There is a mailing list for bug reports and questions regarding SCSI
  development under Linux.  To join, send email to
  majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu with the line subscribe linux-scsi in the
  body of the message.  Messages should be posted to linux-
  scsi@vger.rutgers.edu.  Help text can be requested by sending the
  message line "help" to majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu.

  17.  Other SCSI Access Interfaces

  In Linux there is also another SCSI access method via
  SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND ioctl calls, which is deprecated.  Special
  tools like 'scsiinfo' utilize it.


  There are some other similar interfaces in use in the un*x world, but
  not available for Linux:

  1. CAM (Common Access Method) developed by Future Domain and other
     SCSI vendors. Linux has little support for a SCSI CAM system yet
     (mainly for booting from hard disk).  CAM even supports target
     mode, so one could disguise ones computer as a peripheral hardware
     device (e.g. for a small SCSI net).


  2. ASPI (Advanced SCSI Programming Interface) developed by Adaptec.
     This is the de facto standard for MS-DOS machines.

  There are other application interfaces from SCO(TM), NeXT(TM), Silicon
  Graphics(TM) and SUN(TM) as well.


  18.  Final Comments

  The generic SCSI interface bridges the gap between user applications
  and specific devices. But rather than bloating a lot of programs with
  similar sets of low-level functions, it would be more desirable to
  have a shared library with a generalized set of low-level functions
  for a particular purpose.  The main goal should be to have independent
  layers of interfaces.  A good design would separate an application
  into low-level and hardware independent routines. The low-level
  routines could be put into a shared library and made available for all
  applications. Here, standardized interfaces should be followed as much
  as possible before making new ones.

  By now you should know more than I do about the Linux generic SCSI
  interface. So you can start developing powerful applications for the
  benefit of the global Linux community now...

  T.  Appendix


  U.  Error handling


  The functions open, ioctl, write and read can report errors. In this
  case their return value is -1 and the global variable errno is set to
  the error number.  The errno values are defined in
  /usr/include/errno.h.  Possible values are:



  Function | Error        | Description
  =========|==============|=============================================
  open     | ENXIO        | not a valid device
           | EACCES       | access mode is not read/write (O_RDWR)
           | EBUSY        | device was requested for nonblocking access,
           |              | but is busy now.
           | ERESTARTSYS  | this indicates an internal error. Try to
           |              | make it reproducible and inform the SCSI
           |              | channel (for details on bug reporting
           |              | see Drew Eckhardts SCSI-HOWTO).
  ioctl    | ENXIO        | not a valid device
  read     | EAGAIN       | the device would block. Try again later.
           | ERESTARTSYS  | this indicates an internal error. Try to
           |              | make it reproducible and inform the SCSI
           |              | channel (for details on bug reporting
           |              | see Drew Eckhardts SCSI-HOWTO).
  write    | EIO          | the length is too small (smaller than the
           |              | generic header struct). Caution: Currently
           |              | there is no overlength checking.
           | EAGAIN       | the device would block. Try again later.
           | ENOMEM       | memory required for this request could not be
           |              | allocated. Try later again unless you
           |              | exceeded the maximum transfer size (see above)
  select   |              | none
  close    |              | none



  For read/write positive return values indicate as usual the amount of
  bytes that have been successfully transferred. This should equal the
  amount you requested.


  U.1.  Error status decoding


  Furthermore a detailed reporting is done via the kernels hd_status and
  the devices sense_buffer (see section ``'') both from the generic
  header structure.

  The meaning of hd_status can be found in drivers/scsi/scsi.h: This
  unsigned int is composed out of different parts:



         lsb  |    ...    |    ...    | msb
       =======|===========|===========|============
       status | sense key | host code | driver byte



  These macros from drivers/scsi/scsi.h are available, but unfortunately
  cannot be easily used due to weird header file interdependencies. This
  has to be cleaned.



          Macro          | Description
  =======================|=================================================
  status_byte(hd_status) | The SCSI device status. See section Status codes
  msg_byte(hd_status)    | From the device. See section SCSI sense keys
  host_byte(hd_status)   | From the kernel. See section Hostcodes
  driver_byte(hd_status) | From the kernel. See section midlevel codes



  U.2.  Status codes


  The following status codes from the SCSI device (defined in
  scsi/scsi.h) are available.



       Value | Symbol
       ======|=====================
       0x00  | GOOD
       0x01  | CHECK_CONDITION
       0x02  | CONDITION_GOOD
       0x04  | BUSY
       0x08  | INTERMEDIATE_GOOD
       0x0a  | INTERMEDIATE_C_GOOD
       0x0c  | RESERVATION_CONFLICT



  Note that these symbol values have been shifted right once.  When the
  status is CHECK_CONDITION, the sense data in the sense buffer is valid
  (check especially the additional sense code and additional sense code
  qualifier).

  These values carry the meaning from the SCSI-2 specification:

  +================================================================+

  A definition of the status byte codes is given below.

  GOOD.  This status indicates that the target has successfully completed the
  command.

  CHECK CONDITION.  This status indicates that a contingent allegiance condition
  has occurred (see 6.6).

  CONDITION MET.  This status or INTERMEDIATE-CONDITION MET is returned whenever
  the requested operation is satisfied (see the SEARCH DATA and PRE-FETCH
  commands).

  BUSY.  This status indicates that the target is busy.  This status shall be
  returned whenever a target is unable to accept a command from an otherwise
  acceptable initiator (i.e., no reservation conflicts).  The recommended
  initiator recovery action is to issue the command again at a later time.

  INTERMEDIATE.  This status or INTERMEDIATE-CONDITION MET shall be returned for
  every successfully completed command in a series of linked commands (except
  the last command), unless the command is terminated with CHECK CONDITION,
  RESERVATION CONFLICT, or COMMAND TERMINATED status.  If INTERMEDIATE or
  INTERMEDIATE-CONDITION MET status is not returned, the series of linked
  commands is terminated and the I/O process is ended.

  INTERMEDIATE-CONDITION MET.  This status is the combination of the CONDITION
  MET and INTERMEDIATE statuses.

  RESERVATION CONFLICT.  This status shall be returned whenever an initiator
  attempts to access a logical unit or an extent within a logical unit that is
  reserved with a conflicting reservation type for another SCSI device (see the
  RESERVE and RESERVE UNIT commands).  The recommended initiator recovery action
  is to issue the command again at a later time.

  COMMAND TERMINATED.  This status shall be returned whenever the target
  terminates the current I/O process after receiving a TERMINATE I/O PROCESS
  message (see 5.6.22).  This status also indicates that a contingent allegiance
  condition has occurred (see 6.6).

  QUEUE FULL.  This status shall be implemented if tagged queuing is
  implemented.  This status is returned when a SIMPLE QUEUE TAG, ORDERED QUEUE
  TAG, or HEAD OF QUEUE TAG message is received and the command queue is full.
  The I/O process is not placed in the command queue.



  U.3.  SCSI Sense Keys


  These kernel symbols (from scsi/scsi.h) are predefined:



       Value | Symbol
       ======|================
       0x00  | NO_SENSE
       0x01  | RECOVERED_ERROR
       0x02  | NOT_READY
       0x03  | MEDIUM_ERROR
       0x04  | HARDWARE_ERROR
       0x05  | ILLEGAL_REQUEST
       0x06  | UNIT_ATTENTION
       0x07  | DATA_PROTECT
       0x08  | BLANK_CHECK
       0x0a  | COPY_ABORTED
       0x0b  | ABORTED_COMMAND
       0x0d  | VOLUME_OVERFLOW
       0x0e  | MISCOMPARE

  +========-====================================================================+
  | Sense  |  Description                                                       |
  |  Key   |                                                                    |
  |--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |   0h   |  NO SENSE.  Indicates that there is no specific sense key          |
  |        |  information to be reported for the designated logical unit.  This |
  |        |  would be the case for a successful command or a command that      |
  |        |  received CHECK CONDITION or COMMAND TERMINATED status because one |
  |        |  of the filemark, EOM, or ILI bits is set to one.                  |
  |--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |   1h   |  RECOVERED ERROR.  Indicates that the last command completed       |
  |        |  successfully with some recovery action performed by the target.   |
  |        |  Details may be determinable by examining the additional sense     |
  |        |  bytes and the information field.  When multiple recovered errors  |
  |        |  occur during one command, the choice of which error to report     |
  |        |  (first, last, most severe, etc.) is device specific.              |
  |--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |   2h   |  NOT READY.  Indicates that the logical unit addressed cannot be   |
  |        |  accessed.  Operator intervention may be required to correct this  |
  |        |  condition.                                                        |
  |--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |   3h   |  MEDIUM ERROR.  Indicates that the command terminated with a non-  |
  |        |  recovered error condition that was probably caused by a flaw in   |
  |        |  the medium or an error in the recorded data.  This sense key may  |
  |        |  also be returned if the target is unable to distinguish between a |
  |        |  flaw in the medium and a specific hardware failure (sense key 4h).|
  |--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |   4h   |  HARDWARE ERROR.  Indicates that the target detected a non-        |
  |        |  recoverable hardware failure (for example, controller failure,    |
  |        |  device failure, parity error, etc.) while performing the command  |
  |        |  or during a self test.                                            |
  |--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |   5h   |  ILLEGAL REQUEST.  Indicates that there was an illegal parameter in|
  |        |  the command descriptor block or in the additional parameters      |
  |        |  supplied as data for some commands (FORMAT UNIT, SEARCH DATA,     |
  |        |  etc.).  If the target detects an invalid parameter in the command |
  |        |  descriptor block, then it shall terminate the command without     |
  |        |  altering the medium.  If the target detects an invalid parameter  |
  |        |  in the additional parameters supplied as data, then the target may|
  |        |  have already altered the medium.  This sense key may also indicate|
  |        |  that an invalid IDENTIFY message was received (5.6.7).            |
  |--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |   6h   |  UNIT ATTENTION.  Indicates that the removable medium may have been|
  |        |  changed or the target has been reset.  See 6.9 for more detailed  |
  |        |  information about the unit attention condition.                   |
  |--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |   7h   |  DATA PROTECT.  Indicates that a command that reads or writes the  |
  |        |  medium was attempted on a block that is protected from this       |
  |        |  operation.  The read or write operation is not performed.         |

  |        |  access device encountered blank medium or format-defined end-of-  |
  |        |  data indication while reading or a write-once device encountered a|

  |   Ah   |  COPY ABORTED.  Indicates a COPY, COMPARE, or COPY AND VERIFY      |
  |        |  command was aborted due to an error condition on the source       |
  |        |  device, the destination device, or both.  (See 7.2.3.2 for        |
  |        |  additional information about this sense key.)                     |
  |--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |   Bh   |  ABORTED COMMAND.  Indicates that the target aborted the command.  |
  |        |  The initiator may be able to recover by trying the command again. |
  |--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |   Ch   |  EQUAL.  Indicates a SEARCH DATA command has satisfied an equal    |

  |--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
  |   Dh   |  VOLUME OVERFLOW.  Indicates that a buffered peripheral device has |
  |        |  reached the end-of-partition and data may remain in the buffer    |
  |        |  that has not been written to the medium.  A RECOVER BUFFERED DATA |

  U.5.  Driver codes


  The midlevel driver categorizes the returned status from the lowlevel
  driver based on the sense key from the device. It suggests some
  actions to be taken such as retry, abort or remap. The routine
  scsi_done from scsi.c does a very differentiated handling based on
  host_byte(), status_byte(), msg_byte() and the suggestion. It then
  sets the driver byte to show what it has done. The driver byte is
  composed out of two nibbles: the driver status and the suggestion.
  Each half is composed from the below values being 'or'ed together
  (found in scsi.h).


       Value | Symbol         | Description of Driver status
       ======|================|========================================
       0x00  | DRIVER_OK      | No error
       0x01  | DRIVER_BUSY    | not used
       0x02  | DRIVER_SOFT    | not used
       0x03  | DRIVER_MEDIA   | not used
       0x04  | DRIVER_ERROR   | internal driver error
       0x05  | DRIVER_INVALID | finished (DID_BAD_TARGET or DID_ABORT)
       0x06  | DRIVER_TIMEOUT | finished with timeout
       0x07  | DRIVER_HARD    | finished with fatal error
       0x08  | DRIVER_SENSE   | had sense information available



       Value | Symbol         | Description of suggestion
       ======|================|========================================
       0x10  | SUGGEST_RETRY  | retry the SCSI request
       0x20  | SUGGEST_ABORT  | abort the request
       0x30  | SUGGEST_REMAP  | remap the block (not yet implemented)
       0x40  | SUGGEST_DIE    | let the kernel panic
       0x80  | SUGGEST_SENSE  | get sense information from the device
       0xff  | SUGGEST_IS_OK  | nothing to be done



  V.  Additional sense codes and additional sense code qualifiers


  When the status of the executed SCSI command is CHECK_CONDITION, sense
  data is available in the sense buffer. The additional sense code and
  additional sense code qualifier are contained in that buffer.

  From the SCSI-2 specification I include two tables. The first is in
  lexical, the second in numerical order.


  V.1.  ASC and ASCQ in lexical order

  The following table list gives a list of descriptions and device types
  they apply to.
