  2.  The Procedure



  2.1.  Introduction

  This document for installing Linux on a LapTop (Acer TravelMate 345T)
  It comprises of the general difficulties you can run into while trying
  an install on an Acer TravelMate 345T. I have a hand on experience
  only on Acer TravelMate 345T. This may be applicable to other Models
  also.

  This document assumes some basic familiarity with concepts of Linux
  system administration. For example, you should know about directories
  and filesystems.

  2.2.  Preparing the Disk

  The document specifically tells about the installation of Linux on a
  Laptop along with Windows 98.


  First you should partition the disk according to your choice. You may
  face problems when you want a dual boot machine. That is you have
  Windows on /dev/hda1 and Linux '/' on /dev/hda2

  I faced some strange problem here. Initially I had a 5.3 GB disk on
  which Windows 98 was installed and drive c: constituted the entire
  5.3GB.

  I wanted to repartition the disk to put Linux on to it. So I booted
  with a RedHat CD and partitioned the disk as follows.



         /dev/hda1   3 GB    For Windows 98
         /dev/hda2   200 MB  For Linux /
         /dev/hda3   128 MB  For Swap
         /dev/hda4   2 GB    Extended
         /dev/hda5   1GB     /usr
         /dev/hda6   1GB     /home1



  After installation of Linux, I found that Windows 98 was still running
  fine on /dev/hda1. Even more interesting fact is that Windows is able
  to see that entire 5.3 GB of the disk. I doubted that this could lead
  to corruption of data and had no other way except formatting and start
  again. Any feedback on this issue is welcome. Any links or references
  are also welcome.

  Note: When you list the partitions with a dos fdisk, the extended
  partition made with Linux fdisk is shown as an EXT DOS partition.
  Later I changed the type of Extended partition to Extended Linux.
  Still Windows was able to see the entire 5.3 GB of the disk.

  I have put /dev/hda2 as the '/' partition and put /dev/hda5 as '/usr'.
  This approach will help in separating the files that change frequently
  from those that doesn't. This is also useful for backup purposes.

  2.3.  Installation

  Installation of RedHat Linux on a Laptop is pretty easy. This is
  almost like installing Linux on a PC. The only problem we faced was
  that it was not possible to install Linux from the RedHat CD in any
  mode other than will cause the installation to hang.

  2.4.  Booting the Machine

  The Acer LapTop had some PCMICA devices. While booting the LapTop, the
  machine would hang looking for more pcmcia devices. If you face this
  problem, you need to reboot the machine with the boot floppy and edit
  the file /etc/sysconfig/pcmcia and set PCIC_OPTS="do_scan=0". The next
  time you reboot the machine, it should boot up with the newly
  installed Linux.

  2.5.  Configuring X

  This is problem for which I was not able to find an answer. After
  booting up the machine, I tried to configure X using xf86config.

  The Acer LapTop had an 800x600 LCD panel. I had selected S-VGA and
  800x600 resolution. When I tried starting X, I found that the mode is
  being taken as 320x200. The boot message says that it is the built-in
  mode. Any Pointers to this are welcome. The output of SuperProbe was:

         First video: Super-VGA
               Chipset: Trident (chipset unknown) (PCI Probed)
                       Signature data: 95251023 (please report)
               Memory:  2048 Kbytes
               RAMDAC:  Sierra SC1148{2,3,4} 15-bit or SC1148{5,7,9} 15/16-bit HiColor
                        (with 6-bit wide lookup tables (or in 6-bit mode))



  2.6.  Linmodem Source

  The Laptop had a softmodem (Linmodem). The driver for this modem is
  not given in the RedHat distribution. Lucent is providing the driver
  for this modem in 'object' form. The source for this driver is not
  available.  It will be good if the Linux community can provide the
  source for the Linmodem. The difficulty with the Lucent Linmodem
  driver is that, the driver is written for Linux 2.2.12 Kernel. This is
  one of the reason why the source code for Linmodem would be considered
  a great contribution. I have listed some links that could proove to be
  useful in this venture.

  3.  Conclusion

  This document has covered the problems faced during the installation
  of Linux on a Laptop. The document may not be complete any feedback or
  contribution towards this will be appreciated. The main area on which
  the Linux community can work is in solving out problems in configuring
  X and getting the source code for the Linmodem driver.

  Please mail your contributions for this document to
  harish.thampi@wipro.com so that I can come up with the next version of
  this document.
